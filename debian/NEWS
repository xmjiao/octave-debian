octave (3.8.1-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * The just-it-time (JIT) compiler has been disabled in this version,
    because it creates problems with the Gallium llvmpipe Mesa driver.
    Since the JIT is currently very basic, it is not worth the trouble. It
    may be re-enabled later when the benefits outweigh the costs. See
    #743260 for more details.

octave (3.8.0~rc1-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  * Starting with this version, the octave package now contains an
    experimental graphical user interface (GUI) based on the Qt toolkit.
    That GUI can be started by giving the `--force-gui' option to the
    octave binary.

  * For those who want to keep the lower memory footprint of a pure text
    interface, there is the `octave-cli' executable which is not linked
    against Qt.

  * Starting with this version, Octave incorporates a just-in-time (JIT)
    compiler, which can offer performance improvements in some situations.
    Since it is still experimental, the JIT is disabled by default, but
    you can activate it with the `jit_enable' command.
