octave (3.8.0~rc1-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  * Starting with this version, the octave package now contains an
    experimental graphical user interface (GUI) based on the Qt toolkit.
    That GUI can be started by running the `octave-gui' executable, or by
    giving the `--force-gui' option to the octave binary.

  * For those who want to keep the lower memory footprint of a pure text
    interface, there is the `octave-cli' executable which is not linked
    against Qt.

  * Starting with this version, Octave incorporates a just-in-time (JIT)
    compiler, which can offer performance improvements in some situations.
    Since it is still experimental, the JIT is disabled by default, but
    you can activate it with the `jit_enable' command.
