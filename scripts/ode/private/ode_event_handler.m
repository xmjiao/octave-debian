## Return the solution of the event function that is specified as the first
## input argument @var{@@evtfun} in the form of a function handle.
##
## The second input argument @var{t} is of type double scalar and
## specifies the time of the event evaluation, the third input argument
## @var{y} either is of type double column vector (for ODEs and DAEs) and
## specifies the solutions or is of type cell array (for IDEs and DDEs) and
## specifies the derivatives or the history values, the third input argument
## @var{flag} is of type string and can be of the form
##
## @table @option
## @item  @qcode{"init"}
## then initialize internal persistent variables of the function
## @code{ode_event_handler} and return an empty cell array of size 4,
##
## @item  @qcode{"calc"}
## then do the evaluation of the event function and return the solution
## @var{sol} as type cell array of size 4,
##
## @item  @qcode{"done"}
## then cleanup internal variables of the function
## @code{ode_event_handler} and return an empty cell array of size 4.

## Optionally if further input arguments @var{par1}, @var{par2}, @dots{} of

## This function is an ODE internal helper function therefore it should
