@anchor{XREFfigurenumbertitle}
@cindex figure numbertitle
@item @code{numbertitle}: @qcode{"off"} | @{@qcode{"on"}@}

@anchor{XREFfigureouterposition}
@cindex figure outerposition
@item @code{outerposition}: four-element vector, def. @code{[-1  -1  -1  -1]}
Specify the position and size of the figure including the top menubar and the bottom status bar.  The four elements of the vector are the coordinates of the lower left corner and width and height of the figure.  @xref{XREFfigureunits, , @w{units property}}.


@anchor{XREFfigurepaperorientation}
@cindex figure paperorientation
@item @code{paperorientation}: @qcode{"landscape"} | @{@qcode{"portrait"}@}
The value for the @code{papersize}, and @code{paperposition} properties depends upon @code{paperorientation}.  The horizontal and vertical values for @code{papersize} and @code{paperposition} reverse order when @code{paperorientation} is switched between @code{"portrait"} and @code{"landscape"}.


@anchor{XREFfigurepaperposition}
@cindex figure paperposition
@item @code{paperposition}: four-element vector, def. @code{[0.25000   2.50000   8.00000   6.00000]}
Vector @code{[left bottom width height]} defining the position and size of the figure (in @code{paperunits} units) on the printed page.  The position @code{[left bottom]} defines the lower left corner of the figure on the page, and the size is defined by @code{[width height]}.  For output formats not implicitly rendered on paper, @code{width} and @code{height} define the size of the image and the position information is ignored.  Setting @code{paperposition} also forces the @code{paperpositionmode} property to be set to @qcode{"manual"}.


@anchor{XREFfigurepaperpositionmode}
@cindex figure paperpositionmode
@item @code{paperpositionmode}: @qcode{"auto"} | @{@qcode{"manual"}@}
If @code{paperpositionmode} is set to @qcode{"auto"}, the @code{paperposition} property is automatically computed: the printed figure will have the same size as the on-screen figure and will be centered on the output page.  Setting the @code{paperpositionmode} to @code{"auto"} does not modify the value of the @code{paperposition} property.


@anchor{XREFfigurepapersize}
@cindex figure papersize
@item @code{papersize}: two-element vector, def. @code{[8.5000   11.0000]}
Vector @code{[width height]} defining the size of the paper for printing.  Setting the @code{papersize} property to a value, not associated with one of the defined @code{papertypes} and consistent with the setting for @code{paperorientation}, forces the @code{papertype} property to the value @qcode{"<custom>"}.  If @code{papersize} is set to a value associated with a supported @code{papertype} and consistent with the @code{paperorientation}, the @code{papertype} value is modified to the associated value.


@anchor{XREFfigurepapertype}
@cindex figure papertype
@item @code{papertype}: @qcode{"<custom>"} | @qcode{"a"} | @qcode{"a0"} | @qcode{"a1"} | @qcode{"a2"} | @qcode{"a3"} | @qcode{"a4"} | @qcode{"a5"} | @qcode{"arch-a"} | @qcode{"arch-b"} | @qcode{"arch-c"} | @qcode{"arch-d"} | @qcode{"arch-e"} | @qcode{"b"} | @qcode{"b0"} | @qcode{"b1"} | @qcode{"b2"} | @qcode{"b3"} | @qcode{"b4"} | @qcode{"b5"} | @qcode{"c"} | @qcode{"d"} | @qcode{"e"} | @qcode{"tabloid"} | @qcode{"uslegal"} | @{@qcode{"usletter"}@}
Name of the paper used for printed output.  Setting @code{papertype} also changes @code{papersize}, while maintaining consistency with the @code{paperorientation} property.


@anchor{XREFfigurepaperunits}
@cindex figure paperunits
@item @code{paperunits}: @qcode{"centimeters"} | @{@qcode{"inches"}@} | @qcode{"normalized"} | @qcode{"points"}
The unit used to compute the @code{paperposition} property.  For @code{paperunits} set to @code{"pixels"}, the conversion between physical units (ex: @code{"inches"}) and @code{"pixels"} is dependent on the @code{screenpixelsperinch} property of the root object.

@item @code{parent}: graphics handle, def. @code{0}
Handle of the parent graphics object.


@anchor{XREFfigurepointer}
