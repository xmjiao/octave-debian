This chapter documents the linear algebra functions of Octave.
Reference material for many of these functions may be found in
Golub and Van Loan, @cite{Matrix Computations, 2nd Ed.}, Johns Hopkins,
1989, and in the @cite{@sc{lapack} Users' Guide}, SIAM, 1992.

@section Techniques Used for Linear Algebra

Octave includes a polymorphic solver, that selects an appropriate
matrix factorization depending on the properties of the matrix itself. 
Generally, the cost of determining the matrix type is small relative to 
the cost of factorizing the matrix itself, but in any case the matrix 
type is cached once it is calculated, so that it is not re-determined 
each time it is used in a linear equation.

The selection tree for how the linear equation is solve or a matrix
inverse is form is given by

@enumerate 1
@item If the matrix is upper or lower triangular sparse a forward or
backward substitution using the @sc{lapack} xTRTRS function, and goto 4.

@c Permuted triangular matrices currently disabled in the code
@c
@c @item If the matrix is a upper triangular matrix with column permutations
@c or lower triangular matrix with row permutations, perform a forward or
@c backward substitution, and goto 5.

@item If the matrix is square, Hermitian with a real positive diagonal,
attempt Cholesky@tie{}factorization using the @sc{lapack} xPOTRF function.

@item If the Cholesky@tie{}factorization failed or the matrix is not
Hermitian with a real positive diagonal, and the matrix is square, factorize 
using the @sc{lapack} xGETRF function.

@item If the matrix is not square, or any of the previous solvers flags
a singular or near singular matrix, find a least squares solution using
the @sc{lapack} xGELSD function.
@end enumerate

The user can force the type of the matrix with the @code{matrix_type}
function.  This overcomes the cost of discovering the type of the matrix.
However, it should be noted that identifying the type of the matrix incorrectly
will lead to unpredictable results, and so @code{matrix_type} should be
used with care.

It should be noted that the test for whether a matrix is a candidate for
Cholesky@tie{}factorization, performed above and by the @code{matrix_type}
function, does not give a certainty that the matrix is
Hermitian.  However, the attempt to factorize the matrix will quickly
flag a non-Hermitian matrix.

@deftypefnx {Loadable Function} {[@var{D}, @var{P}, @var{AA}] =} balance (@var{A}, @var{opt})
@deftypefnx {Loadable Function} {[@var{CC}, @var{DD}, @var{AA}, @var{BB}] =} balance (@var{A}, @var{B}, @var{opt})

Compute @code{@var{AA} = @var{DD} \ @var{A} * @var{DD}} in which @var{AA}
is a matrix whose row and column norms are roughly equal in magnitude, and
@code{@var{DD} = @var{P} * @var{D}}, in which @var{P} is a permutation
matrix and @var{D} is a diagonal matrix of powers of two.  This allows the
equilibration to be computed without round-off.  Results of eigenvalue
calculation are typically improved by balancing first.

If two output values are requested, @code{balance} returns
the diagonal @var{D} and the permutation @var{P} separately as vectors.
In this case, @code{@var{DD} = eye(n)(:,@var{P}) * diag (@var{D})}, where
@math{n} is the matrix size.

If four output values are requested, compute @code{@var{AA} =
@var{CC}*@var{A}*@var{DD}} and @code{@var{BB} = @var{CC}*@var{B}*@var{DD}},
in which @var{AA} and @var{BB} have non-zero elements of approximately the
same magnitude and @var{CC} and @var{DD} are permuted diagonal matrices as
in @var{DD} for the algebraic eigenvalue problem.

The eigenvalue balancing option @var{opt} may be one of:

@table @asis
@item "noperm", "S"
Scale only; do not permute.

@item "noscal", "P"
Permute only; do not scale.
@end table

Algebraic eigenvalue balancing uses standard @sc{lapack} routines.

Generalized eigenvalue problem balancing uses Ward's algorithm
(SIAM Journal on Scientific and Statistical Computing, 1981).

@deftypefn  {Function File} {} cond (@var{A})

@end tex

By default @code{@var{p} = 2} is used which implies a (relatively slow)
singular value decomposition.  Other possible selections are
@code{@var{p} = 1, Inf, "fro"} which are generally faster.  See
@code{norm} for a full discussion of possible @var{p} values.

Routines from @sc{lapack} are used for full matrices and code from

The determinant should not be used to check a matrix for singularity.
For that, use any of the condition number functions: @code{cond},
@code{condest}, @code{rcond}.

@deftypefnx {Loadable Function} {[@var{V}, @var{lambda}] =} eig (@var{A}, @var{B})
Compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix.

Eigenvalues are computed in a several step process which begins with a
Hessenberg decomposition, followed by a Schur@tie{}decomposition, from which
the eigenvalues are apparent.  The eigenvectors, when desired, are computed
by further manipulations of the Schur@tie{}decomposition.

The eigenvalues returned by @code{eig} are not ordered.

@deftypefn  {Loadable Function} {@var{x} =} inv (@var{A})

Compute the inverse of the square matrix @var{A}.  Return an estimate
of the reciprocal condition number if requested, otherwise warn of an
ill-conditioned matrix if the reciprocal condition number is small.

In general it is best to avoid calculating the inverse of a matrix
directly.  For example, it is both faster and more accurate to solve
systems of equations (@var{A}*@math{x} = @math{b}) with
@code{@var{y} = @var{A} \ @math{b}}, rather than
@code{@var{y} = inv (@var{A}) * @math{b}}.

If called with a sparse matrix, then in general @var{x} will be a full
matrix requiring significantly more storage.  Avoid forming the inverse
of a sparse matrix if possible.

@deftypefnx {Loadable Function} {@var{A} =} matrix_type (@var{A}, 'banded', @var{nl}, @var{nu})
Identify the matrix type or mark a matrix as a particular type.  This allows
more rapid solutions of linear equations involving @var{A} to be performed.
Called with a single argument, @code{matrix_type} returns the type of the
matrix and caches it for future use.  Called with more than one argument,
@code{matrix_type} allows the type of the matrix to be defined.

If the option 'nocompute' is given, the function will not attempt to guess
the type if it is still unknown.  This is useful for debugging purposes.

The possible matrix types depend on whether the matrix is full or sparse, and
can be one of the following

@table @asis
@item 'unknown'
Remove any previously cached matrix type, and mark type as unknown.

@item 'full'
Mark the matrix as full.

@item 'positive definite'
Probable full positive definite matrix.

@item 'diagonal'
Diagonal matrix.  (Sparse matrices only)

@item 'permuted diagonal'
Permuted Diagonal matrix.  The permutation does not need to be specifically
indicated, as the structure of the matrix explicitly gives this.  (Sparse
matrices only)

@item 'upper'
Upper triangular.  If the optional third argument @var{perm} is given, the
matrix is assumed to be a permuted upper triangular with the permutations
defined by the vector @var{perm}.

@item 'lower'
Lower triangular.  If the optional third argument @var{perm} is given, the
matrix is assumed to be a permuted lower triangular with the permutations
defined by the vector @var{perm}.

@item 'banded'
@itemx 'banded positive definite'
Banded matrix with the band size of @var{nl} below the diagonal and @var{nu}
above it.  If @var{nl} and @var{nu} are 1, then the matrix is tridiagonal and
treated with specialized code.  In addition the matrix can be marked as
probably a positive definite.  (Sparse matrices only)

@item 'singular'
The matrix is assumed to be singular and will be treated with a minimum norm
solution.

@end table

Note that the matrix type will be discovered automatically on the first
attempt to solve a linear equation involving @var{A}.  Therefore
@code{matrix_type} is only useful to give Octave hints of the matrix type.
Incorrectly defining the matrix type will result in incorrect results from
solutions of linear equations; it is entirely @strong{the responsibility of
the user} to correctly identify the matrix type.

Also, the test for positive definiteness is a low-cost test for a Hermitian
matrix with a real positive diagonal.  This does not guarantee that the
matrix is positive definite, but only that it is a probable candidate.  When
such a matrix is factorized, a Cholesky@tie{}factorization is first
attempted, and if that fails the matrix is then treated with an
LU@tie{}factorization.  Once the matrix has been factorized,
@code{matrix_type} will return the correct classification of the matrix.

Compute the p-norm of the matrix @var{A}.  If the second argument is
missing, @code{p = 2} is assumed.

If @var{A} is a matrix (or sparse matrix):

@table @asis
@item @var{p} = @code{1}
1-norm, the largest column sum of the absolute values of @var{A}.

@item @var{p} = @code{2}
Largest singular value of @var{A}.

@item @var{p} = @code{Inf} or @code{"inf"}
@cindex infinity norm
Infinity norm, the largest row sum of the absolute values of @var{A}.

@item @var{p} = @code{"fro"}
@cindex Frobenius norm
Frobenius norm of @var{A}, @code{sqrt (sum (diag (@var{A}' * @var{A})))}.

@item other @var{p}, @code{@var{p} > 1}
@cindex general p-norm

@item @var{p} = @code{Inf} or @code{"inf"}
@code{max (abs (@var{A}))}.

@item @var{p} = @code{-Inf}
@code{min (abs (@var{A}))}.

@item @var{p} = @code{"fro"}
Frobenius norm of @var{A}, @code{sqrt (sumsq (abs (A)))}.

@item @var{p} = 0
Hamming norm - the number of nonzero elements.

@item other @var{p}, @code{@var{p} > 1}
p-norm of @var{A}, @code{(sum (abs (@var{A}) .^ @var{p})) ^ (1/@var{p})}.

@item other @var{p} @code{@var{p} < 1}
the p-pseudonorm defined as above.
@end table

If @var{opt} is the value @code{"rows"}, treat each row as a vector and
compute its norm.  The result is returned as a column vector.
Similarly, if @var{opt} is @code{"columns"} or @code{"cols"} then compute
the norms of each column and return a row vector.

Return an orthonormal basis of the null space of @var{A}.

The dimension of the null space is taken as the number of singular
values of @var{A} not greater than @var{tol}.  If the argument @var{tol}
is missing, it is computed as

orthonormal basis @var{v} using a modified Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization.  
On exit, @var{y} is a unit vector such that:

@example

Return the pseudoinverse of @var{x}.  Singular values less than
@var{tol} are ignored.

If the second argument is omitted, it is taken to be

@example
tol = max (size (@var{x})) * sigma_max (@var{x}) * eps,
@end example

where @code{sigma_max (@var{x})} is the maximal singular value of @var{x}.

@deftypefn  {Function File} {} rank (@var{A})

Compute the rank of @var{A}, using the singular value decomposition.
The rank is taken to be the number of singular values of @var{A} that
are greater than the specified tolerance @var{tol}.  If the second
argument is omitted, it is taken to be

@example
tol = max (size (@var{A})) * sigma(1) * eps;

@deftypefn {Loadable Function} {@var{c} =} rcond (@var{A})
Compute the 1-norm estimate of the reciprocal condition number as returned
by @sc{lapack}.  If the matrix is well-conditioned then @var{c} will be near
1 and if the matrix is poorly conditioned it will be close to zero.

The matrix @var{A} must not be sparse.  If the matrix is sparse then
@code{condest (@var{A})} or @code{rcond (full (@var{A}))} should be used
instead.

@tex
$ R^T R = A $.
@end tex
@ifnottex

@example
@var{R}' * @var{R} = @var{A}.
@end example

@end ifnottex

Called with one output argument @code{chol} fails if @var{A} or @var{S} is
not positive definite.  With two or more output arguments @var{p} flags
whether the matrix was positive definite and @code{chol} does not fail.  A
zero value indicated that the matrix was positive definite and the @var{R}
gives the factorization, and @var{p} will have a positive value otherwise.

If called with 3 outputs then a sparsity preserving row/column permutation
is applied to @var{A} prior to the factorization.  That is @var{R}
is the factorization of @code{@var{A}(@var{Q},@var{Q})} such that
@tex
$ R^T R = Q^T A Q$.
@end tex
@ifnottex

@example
@var{R}' * @var{R} = @var{Q}' * @var{A} * @var{Q}.
@end example

@end ifnottex

The sparsity preserving permutation is generally returned as a matrix.
However, given the flag 'vector', @var{Q} will be returned as a vector
such that
@tex
$ R^T R = A (Q, Q)$.
@end tex
@ifnottex

@example
@var{R}' * @var{R} = @var{A}(@var{Q}, @var{Q}).
@end example

@end ifnottex

Called with either a sparse or full matrix and using the 'lower' flag,
@code{chol} returns the lower triangular factorization such that
@tex
$ L L^T = A $.
@end tex
@ifnottex

@example
@var{L} * @var{L}' = @var{A}.
@end example

@end ifnottex

For full matrices, if the 'lower' flag is set only the lower triangular part
of the matrix is used for the factorization, otherwise the upper triangular
part is used.

In general the lower triangular factorization is significantly faster for
sparse matrices.

result is returned in a permuted form, according to the optional return
value @var{P}.  For example, given the matrix @code{a = [1, 2; 3, 4]},

@example
[l, u, p] = lu (@var{a})
@end example

@noindent
returns

@example
@group

  0.00000  0.66667

p =

  0  1
  1  0
@end group
@end example

The matrix is not required to be square.

When called with two or three output arguments and a spare input matrix,
@code{lu} does not attempt to perform sparsity preserving column
permutations.  Called with a fourth output argument, the sparsity
preserving column transformation @var{Q} is returned, such that
@code{@var{P} * @var{A} * @var{Q} = @var{L} * @var{U}}.

Called with a fifth output argument and a sparse input matrix,
@code{lu} attempts to use a scaling factor @var{R} on the input matrix
such that
@code{@var{P} * (@var{R} \ @var{A}) * @var{Q} = @var{L} * @var{U}}.
This typically leads to a sparser and more stable factorization.

An additional input argument @var{thres}, that defines the pivoting
threshold can be given.  @var{thres} can be a scalar, in which case
it defines the @sc{umfpack} pivoting tolerance for both symmetric and
unsymmetric cases.  If @var{thres} is a 2-element vector, then the first
element defines the pivoting tolerance for the unsymmetric @sc{umfpack}
pivoting strategy and the second for the symmetric strategy.  By default,
the values defined by @code{spparms} are used ([0.1, 0.001]).

Given the string argument 'vector', @code{lu} returns the values of @var{P}
and @var{Q} as vector values, such that for full matrix, @code{@var{A}
(@var{P},:) = @var{L} * @var{U}}, and @code{@var{R}(@var{P},:) * @var{A}
(:, @var{Q}) = @var{L} * @var{U}}.

With two output arguments, returns the permuted forms of the upper and
lower triangular matrices, such that @code{@var{A} = @var{L} * @var{U}}.
With one output argument @var{y}, then the matrix returned by the @sc{lapack}
routines is returned.  If the input matrix is sparse then the matrix @var{L}
is embedded into @var{U} to give a return value similar to the full case.
For both full and sparse matrices, @code{lu} loses the permutation
information.

@w{@var{A} = @var{L}*@var{U}}, @var{L}@tie{}lower unit trapezoidal and

of @w{@var{A} + @var{x}*@var{y}.'}, where @var{x} and @var{y} are
column vectors (rank-1 update) or matrices with equal number of columns
(rank-k update).
Optionally, row-pivoted updating can be used by supplying
a row permutation (pivoting) matrix @var{P};
in that case, an updated permutation matrix is returned.
Note that if @var{L}, @var{U}, @var{P} is a pivoted LU@tie{}factorization
as obtained by @code{lu}:

@example
  [@var{L}, @var{U}, @var{P}] = lu (@var{A});
@end example

@noindent
then a factorization of @xcode{@var{A}+@var{x}*@var{y}.'} can be obtained
either as

@example
  [@var{L1}, @var{U1}] = lu (@var{L}, @var{U}, @var{P}*@var{x}, @var{y})
@end example

@noindent
or

@example
  [@var{L1}, @var{U1}, @var{P1}] = lu (@var{L}, @var{U}, @var{P}, @var{x}, @var{y})
@end example

The first form uses the unpivoted algorithm, which is faster, but less
stable.  The second form uses a slower pivoted algorithm, which is more
stable.

The matrix case is done as a sequence of rank-1 updates;
thus, for large enough k, it will be both faster and more accurate to
recompute the factorization from scratch.

The permuted @code{qr} factorization @code{[@var{Q}, @var{R}, @var{P}] = qr
(@var{A})} factorization allows the construction of an orthogonal basis of
@code{span (A)}.

If the matrix @var{A} is sparse, then compute the sparse
QR@tie{}factorization of @var{A}, using @sc{CSparse}.  As the matrix @var{Q}
is in general a full matrix, this function returns the @var{Q}-less
factorization @var{R} of @var{A}, such that @code{@var{R} = chol (@var{A}' *
@var{A})}.

If the final argument is the scalar @code{0} and the number of rows is
larger than the number of columns, then an economy factorization is
returned.  That is @var{R} will have only @code{size (@var{A},1)} rows.

If an additional matrix @var{B} is supplied, then @code{qr} returns
@var{C}, where @code{@var{C} = @var{Q}' * @var{B}}.  This allows the
least squares approximation of @code{@var{A} \ @var{B}} to be calculated

@example
[v a*v a^2*v @dots{} a^(k+1)*v]
@end example

@noindent
Using Householder reflections to guard against loss of orthogonality.

If @var{V} is a vector, then @var{h} contains the Hessenberg matrix
such that @nospell{@xcode{a*u == u*h+rk*ek'}}, in which @code{rk =
a*u(:,k)-u*h(:,k)}, and @nospell{@xcode{ek'}} is the vector
@code{[0, 0, @dots{}, 1]} of length @code{k}.  Otherwise, @var{h} is
meaningless.

If @var{V} is a vector and @var{k} is greater than
@code{length(A)-1}, then @var{h} contains the Hessenberg matrix such
that @code{a*u == u*h}.

The value of @var{nu} is the dimension of the span of the Krylov
subspace (based on @var{eps1}).

If @var{b} is a vector and @var{k} is greater than @var{m-1}, then
@var{h} contains the Hessenberg decomposition of @var{A}.

The optional parameter @var{eps1} is the threshold for zero.  The
default value is 1e-12.

If the optional parameter @var{pflg} is nonzero, row pivoting is used
to improve numerical behavior.  The default value is 0.
