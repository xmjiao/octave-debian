26.6 Tests
==========

Octave can perform many different statistical tests.  The following
table summarizes the available tests.

Hypothesis                    Test Functions
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Equal mean values             ‘anova’, ‘hotelling_test2’,
                              ‘t_test_2’, ‘welch_test’,
                              ‘wilcoxon_test’, ‘z_test_2’
Equal medians                 ‘kruskal_wallis_test’, ‘sign_test’
Equal variances               ‘bartlett_test’, ‘manova’,
                              ‘var_test’
Equal distributions           ‘chisquare_test_homogeneity’,
                              ‘kolmogorov_smirnov_test_2’,
                              ‘u_test’
Equal marginal frequencies    ‘mcnemar_test’
Equal success probabilities   ‘prop_test_2’
Independent observations      ‘chisquare_test_independence’,
                              ‘run_test’
Uncorrelated observations     ‘cor_test’
Given mean value              ‘hotelling_test’, ‘t_test’,
                              ‘z_test’
Observations from given       ‘kolmogorov_smirnov_test’
distribution
Regression                    ‘f_test_regression’,
                              ‘t_test_regression’

   The tests return a p-value that describes the outcome of the test.
Assuming that the test hypothesis is true, the p-value is the
probability of obtaining a worse result than the observed one.  So large
p-values corresponds to a successful test.  Usually a test hypothesis is
accepted if the p-value exceeds 0.05.

 -- : [PVAL, F, DF_B, DF_W] = anova (Y, G)
     Perform a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).

     The goal is to test whether the population means of data taken from
     K different groups are all equal.

     Data may be given in a single vector Y with groups specified by a
     corresponding vector of group labels G (e.g., numbers from 1 to K).
     This is the general form which does not impose any restriction on
     the number of data in each group or the group labels.

     If Y is a matrix and G is omitted, each column of Y is treated as a
     group.  This form is only appropriate for balanced ANOVA in which
     the numbers of samples from each group are all equal.

     Under the null of constant means, the statistic F follows an F
     distribution with DF_B and DF_W degrees of freedom.

     The p-value (1 minus the CDF of this distribution at F) is returned
     in PVAL.

     If no output argument is given, the standard one-way ANOVA table is
     printed.

     See also: *note manova: XREFmanova.

 -- : [PVAL, CHISQ, DF] = bartlett_test (X1, ...)
     Perform a Bartlett test for the homogeneity of variances in the
     data vectors X1, X2, ..., XK, where K > 1.

     Under the null of equal variances, the test statistic CHISQ
     approximately follows a chi-square distribution with DF degrees of
     freedom.

     The p-value (1 minus the CDF of this distribution at CHISQ) is
     returned in PVAL.

     If no output argument is given, the p-value is displayed.

 -- : [PVAL, CHISQ, DF] = chisquare_test_homogeneity (X, Y, C)
     Given two samples X and Y, perform a chisquare test for homogeneity
     of the null hypothesis that X and Y come from the same
     distribution, based on the partition induced by the (strictly
     increasing) entries of C.

     For large samples, the test statistic CHISQ approximately follows a
     chisquare distribution with DF = ‘length (C)’ degrees of freedom.

     The p-value (1 minus the CDF of this distribution at CHISQ) is
     returned in PVAL.

     If no output argument is given, the p-value is displayed.

 -- : [PVAL, CHISQ, DF] = chisquare_test_independence (X)
     Perform a chi-square test for independence based on the contingency
     table X.

     Under the null hypothesis of independence, CHISQ approximately has
     a chi-square distribution with DF degrees of freedom.

     The p-value (1 minus the CDF of this distribution at chisq) of the
     test is returned in PVAL.

     If no output argument is given, the p-value is displayed.

 -- : cor_test (X, Y, ALT, METHOD)
     Test whether two samples X and Y come from uncorrelated
     populations.

     The optional argument string ALT describes the alternative
     hypothesis, and can be "!=" or "<>" (nonzero), ">" (greater than
     0), or "<" (less than 0).  The default is the two-sided case.

     The optional argument string METHOD specifies which correlation
     coefficient to use for testing.  If METHOD is "pearson" (default),
     the (usual) Pearson’s product moment correlation coefficient is
     used.  In this case, the data should come from a bivariate normal
     distribution.  Otherwise, the other two methods offer nonparametric
     alternatives.  If METHOD is "kendall", then Kendall’s rank
     correlation tau is used.  If METHOD is "spearman", then Spearman’s
     rank correlation rho is used.  Only the first character is
     necessary.

     The output is a structure with the following elements:

     PVAL
          The p-value of the test.

     STAT
          The value of the test statistic.

     DIST
          The distribution of the test statistic.

     PARAMS
          The parameters of the null distribution of the test statistic.

     ALTERNATIVE
          The alternative hypothesis.

     METHOD
          The method used for testing.

     If no output argument is given, the p-value is displayed.

     Perform an F test for the null hypothesis rr * b = r in a classical
     normal regression model y = X * b + e.

     Under the null, the test statistic F follows an F distribution with
     DF_NUM and DF_DEN degrees of freedom.

     The p-value (1 minus the CDF of this distribution at F) is returned
     in PVAL.

     If not given explicitly, R = 0.

     If no output argument is given, the p-value is displayed.

 -- : [PVAL, TSQ] = hotelling_test (X, M)
     For a sample X from a multivariate normal distribution with unknown
     mean and covariance matrix, test the null hypothesis that ‘mean (X)
     == M’.

     Hotelling’s T^2 is returned in TSQ.  Under the null, (n-p) T^2 /
     (p(n-1)) has an F distribution with p and n-p degrees of freedom,
     where n and p are the numbers of samples and variables,
     respectively.

     The p-value of the test is returned in PVAL.

     If no output argument is given, the p-value of the test is
     displayed.

 -- : [PVAL, TSQ] = hotelling_test_2 (X, Y)
     For two samples X from multivariate normal distributions with the
     same number of variables (columns), unknown means and unknown equal
     covariance matrices, test the null hypothesis ‘mean (X) == mean
     (Y)’.

     Hotelling’s two-sample T^2 is returned in TSQ.  Under the null,

          (n_x+n_y-p-1) T^2 / (p(n_x+n_y-2))

     has an F distribution with p and n_x+n_y-p-1 degrees of freedom,
     where n_x and n_y are the sample sizes and p is the number of
     variables.

     The p-value of the test is returned in PVAL.

     If no output argument is given, the p-value of the test is
     displayed.

 -- : [PVAL, KS] = kolmogorov_smirnov_test (X, DIST, PARAMS, ALT)
     Perform a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test of the null hypothesis that the
     sample X comes from the (continuous) distribution DIST.

     if F and G are the CDFs corresponding to the sample and dist,
     respectively, then the null is that F == G.

     The optional argument PARAMS contains a list of parameters of DIST.
     For example, to test whether a sample X comes from a uniform
     distribution on [2,4], use

          kolmogorov_smirnov_test (x, "unif", 2, 4)

     DIST can be any string for which a function DISTCDF that calculates
     the CDF of distribution DIST exists.

     With the optional argument string ALT, the alternative of interest
     can be selected.  If ALT is "!=" or "<>", the null is tested
     against the two-sided alternative F != G.  In this case, the test
     statistic KS follows a two-sided Kolmogorov-Smirnov distribution.
     If ALT is ">", the one-sided alternative F > G is considered.
     Similarly for "<", the one-sided alternative F > G is considered.
     In this case, the test statistic KS has a one-sided
     Kolmogorov-Smirnov distribution.  The default is the two-sided
     case.

     The p-value of the test is returned in PVAL.

     If no output argument is given, the p-value is displayed.

 -- : [PVAL, KS, D] = kolmogorov_smirnov_test_2 (X, Y, ALT)

     that the samples X and Y come from the same (continuous)
     distribution.

     If F and G are the CDFs corresponding to the X and Y samples,
     respectively, then the null is that F == G.

     With the optional argument string ALT, the alternative of interest
     can be selected.  If ALT is "!=" or "<>", the null is tested
     against the two-sided alternative F != G.  In this case, the test
     statistic KS follows a two-sided Kolmogorov-Smirnov distribution.
     If ALT is ">", the one-sided alternative F > G is considered.
     Similarly for "<", the one-sided alternative F < G is considered.
     In this case, the test statistic KS has a one-sided
     Kolmogorov-Smirnov distribution.  The default is the two-sided
     case.

     The p-value of the test is returned in PVAL.

     The third returned value, D, is the test statistic, the maximum
     vertical distance between the two cumulative distribution
     functions.

     If no output argument is given, the p-value is displayed.

 -- : [PVAL, K, DF] = kruskal_wallis_test (X1, ...)
     Perform a Kruskal-Wallis one-factor analysis of variance.

     Suppose a variable is observed for K > 1 different groups, and let
     X1, ..., XK be the corresponding data vectors.

     Under the null hypothesis that the ranks in the pooled sample are
     not affected by the group memberships, the test statistic K is
     approximately chi-square with DF = K - 1 degrees of freedom.

     If the data contains ties (some value appears more than once) K is
     divided by

     1 - SUM_TIES / (N^3 - N)

     where SUM_TIES is the sum of T^2 - T over each group of ties where
     T is the number of ties in the group and N is the total number of
     values in the input data.  For more info on this adjustment see
     William H. Kruskal and W. Allen Wallis, ‘Use of Ranks in
     One-Criterion Variance Analysis’, Journal of the American
     Statistical Association, Vol.  47, No.  260 (Dec 1952).

     The p-value (1 minus the CDF of this distribution at K) is returned
     in PVAL.

     If no output argument is given, the p-value is displayed.

 -- : manova (X, G)
     Perform a one-way multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA).

     The goal is to test whether the p-dimensional population means of
     data taken from K different groups are all equal.  All data are
     assumed drawn independently from p-dimensional normal distributions
     with the same covariance matrix.

     The data matrix is given by X.  As usual, rows are observations and
     columns are variables.  The vector G specifies the corresponding
     group labels (e.g., numbers from 1 to K).

     The LR test statistic (Wilks’ Lambda) and approximate p-values are
     computed and displayed.

     With the optional argument ‘alt’, the alternative of interest can
     be selected.  If ALT is "!=" or "<>", the null hypothesis is tested

     stochastically greater than y") is considered.  Similarly for "<",
     the one-sided alternative PROB (X > Y) < 1/2 ("x is stochastically
     less than y") is considered.  The default is the two-sided case.

27 Sets
*******

Octave has a number of functions for managing sets of data.  A set is
defined as a collection of unique elements and is typically represented
by a vector of numbers sorted in ascending order.  Any vector or matrix
can be converted to a set by removing duplicates through the use of the
‘unique’ function.  However, it isn’t necessary to explicitly create a
set as all of the functions which operate on sets will convert their
input to a set before proceeding.

 -- : unique (X)
 -- : unique (X, "rows")
 -- : [Y, I, J] = unique (...)
 -- : [Y, I, J] = unique (..., "first")
 -- : [Y, I, J] = unique (..., "last")
     Return the unique elements of X sorted in ascending order.

     If the input X is a column vector then return a column vector;
     Otherwise, return a row vector.  X may also be a cell array of
     strings.

     If the optional argument "rows" is given then return the unique
     rows of X sorted in ascending order.  The input must be a 2-D
     matrix to use this option.

     If requested, return index vectors I and J such that ‘Y = X(I)’ and
     ‘X = Y(J)’.

     Additionally, if I is a requested output then one of "first" or
     "last" may be given as an input.  If "last" is specified, return
     the highest possible indices in I, otherwise, if "first" is
     specified, return the lowest.  The default is "last".

File: octave.info,  Node: Set Operations,  Up: Sets

27.1 Set Operations
===================

Octave supports several basic set operations.  Octave can compute the
union, intersection, and difference of two sets.  Octave also supports
the _Exclusive Or_ set operation.

   The functions for set operations all work in the same way by
accepting two input sets and returning a third set.  As an example,
assume that ‘a’ and ‘b’ contains two sets, then

     union (a, b)

computes the union of the two sets.

   Finally, determining whether elements belong to a set can be done
with the ‘ismember’ function.  Because sets are ordered this operation
is very efficient and is of order O(log2(n)) which is preferable to the
‘find’ function which is of order O(n).

 -- : C = intersect (A, B)
 -- : C = intersect (A, B, "rows")
 -- : [C, IA, IB] = intersect (...)

     Return the unique elements common to both A and B sorted in
     ascending order.

     If A and B are both row vectors then return a row vector;
     Otherwise, return a column vector.  The inputs may also be cell
     arrays of strings.

     If the optional input "rows" is given then return the common rows
     of A and B.  The inputs must be 2-D matrices to use this option.

     If requested, return index vectors IA and IB such that ‘C = A(IA)’
     and ‘C = B(IB)’.

     Otherwise, return a column vector.  The inputs may also be cell
     arrays of strings.

     If the optional input "rows" is given then return rows that are in

***************************

In Octave, a polynomial is represented by its coefficients (arranged in
descending order).  For example, a vector C of length N+1 corresponds to
the following polynomial of order N

     p(x) = C(1) x^N + ... + C(N) x + C(N+1).

28.1 Evaluating Polynomials
===========================

The value of a polynomial represented by the vector C can be evaluated
at the point X very easily, as the following example shows:

     N = length (c) - 1;
     val = dot (x.^(N:-1:0), c);

While the above example shows how easy it is to compute the value of a
polynomial, it isn’t the most stable algorithm.  With larger polynomials
you should use more elegant algorithms, such as Horner’s Method, which
is exactly what the Octave function ‘polyval’ does.

   In the case where X is a square matrix, the polynomial given by C is
still well-defined.  As when X is a scalar the obvious implementation is
easily expressed in Octave, but also in this case more elegant
algorithms perform better.  The ‘polyvalm’ function provides such an
algorithm.

 -- : Y = polyval (P, X)
 -- : Y = polyval (P, X, [], MU)
 -- : [Y, DY] = polyval (P, X, S)
 -- : [Y, DY] = polyval (P, X, S, MU)

     Evaluate the polynomial P at the specified values of X.

     If X is a vector or matrix, the polynomial is evaluated for each of
     the elements of X.

     When MU is present, evaluate the polynomial for (X-MU(1))/MU(2).

     In addition to evaluating the polynomial, the second output
     represents the prediction interval, Y +/- DY, which contains at
     least 50% of the future predictions.  To calculate the prediction
     interval, the structured variable S, originating from ‘polyfit’,
     must be supplied.

     XREFpolyaffine, *note polyfit: XREFpolyfit, *note roots: XREFroots,
     *note poly: XREFpoly.

 -- : polyvalm (C, X)
     Evaluate a polynomial in the matrix sense.

     ‘polyvalm (C, X)’ will evaluate the polynomial in the matrix sense,
     i.e., matrix multiplication is used instead of element by element
     multiplication as used in ‘polyval’.

     The argument X must be a square matrix.

28.2 Finding Roots
==================

Octave can find the roots of a given polynomial.  This is done by
computing the companion matrix of the polynomial (see the ‘compan’
function for a definition), and then finding its eigenvalues.

 -- : roots (C)

     Compute the roots of the polynomial C.

     For a vector C with N components, return the roots of the
     polynomial

          c(1) * x^(N-1) + ... + c(N-1) * x + c(N)

     As an example, the following code finds the roots of the quadratic
     polynomial

          p(x) = x^2 - 5.

          c = [1, 0, -5];
          roots (c)
          ⇒  2.2361
          ⇒ -2.2361

     Note that the true result is +/- sqrt(5) which is roughly +/-
     2.2361.

     See also: *note poly: XREFpoly, *note compan: XREFcompan, *note
     fzero: XREFfzero.

 -- : Z = polyeig (C0, C1, ..., CL)
 -- : [V, Z] = polyeig (C0, C1, ..., CL)

     Solve the polynomial eigenvalue problem of degree L.

     Given an N*N matrix polynomial

     ‘C(s) = C0 + C1 s + ... + CL s^l’

     ‘polyeig’ solves the eigenvalue problem

     ‘(C0 + C1 + ... + CL)v = 0’.

     Note that the eigenvalues Z are the zeros of the matrix polynomial.
     Z is a row vector with N*L elements.  V is a matrix (N x N*L) with
     columns that correspond to the eigenvectors.

     See also: *note eig: XREFeig, *note eigs: XREFeigs, *note compan:
     XREFcompan.

 -- : compan (C)
     Compute the companion matrix corresponding to polynomial
     coefficient vector C.

     The companion matrix is

               _                                                        _
              |  -c(2)/c(1)   -c(3)/c(1)  ...  -c(N)/c(1)  -c(N+1)/c(1)  |
              |       1            0      ...       0             0      |
              |       0            1      ...       0             0      |
          A = |       .            .      .         .             .      |
              |       .            .       .        .             .      |
              |       .            .        .       .             .      |
              |_      0            0      ...       1             0     _|

     The eigenvalues of the companion matrix are equal to the roots of
     the polynomial.

     XREFeig.

 -- : [MULTP, IDXP] = mpoles (P)
 -- : [MULTP, IDXP] = mpoles (P, TOL)
 -- : [MULTP, IDXP] = mpoles (P, TOL, REORDER)
     Identify unique poles in P and their associated multiplicity.

     The output is ordered from largest pole to smallest pole.

     If the relative difference of two poles is less than TOL then they
     are considered to be multiples.  The default value for TOL is
     0.001.

     If the optional parameter REORDER is zero, poles are not sorted.

     The output MULTP is a vector specifying the multiplicity of the
     poles.  ‘MULTP(n)’ refers to the multiplicity of the Nth pole
     ‘P(IDXP(n))’.

     For example:

          p = [2 3 1 1 2];
          [m, n] = mpoles (p)
             ⇒ m = [1; 1; 2; 1; 2]
             ⇒ n = [2; 5; 1; 4; 3]
             ⇒ p(n) = [3, 2, 2, 1, 1]

28.3 Products of Polynomials
============================

 -- : conv (A, B)
 -- : conv (A, B, SHAPE)
     Convolve two vectors A and B.

     The output convolution is a vector with length equal to ‘length (A)
     + length (B) - 1’.  When A and B are the coefficient vectors of two
     polynomials, the convolution represents the coefficient vector of
     the product polynomial.

     The optional SHAPE argument may be

     SHAPE = "full"
          Return the full convolution.  (default)

     SHAPE = "same"
          Return the central part of the convolution with the same size
          as A.

     See also: *note deconv: XREFdeconv, *note conv2: XREFconv2, *note
     convn: XREFconvn, *note fftconv: XREFfftconv.

 -- : C = convn (A, B)
 -- : C = convn (A, B, SHAPE)
     Return the n-D convolution of A and B.

     The size of the result is determined by the optional SHAPE argument
     which takes the following values

     SHAPE = "full"
          Return the full convolution.  (default)

     SHAPE = "same"
          Return central part of the convolution with the same size as
          A.  The central part of the convolution begins at the indices
          ‘floor ([size(B)/2] + 1)’.

     SHAPE = "valid"
          Return only the parts which do not include zero-padded edges.
          The size of the result is ‘max (size (A) - size (B) + 1, 0)’.

     See also: *note conv2: XREFconv2, *note conv: XREFconv.

 -- : deconv (Y, A)
     Deconvolve two vectors.

     ‘[b, r] = deconv (y, a)’ solves for B and R such that ‘y = conv (a,
     b) + r’.

     If Y and A are polynomial coefficient vectors, B will contain the
     coefficients of the polynomial quotient and R will be a remainder
     polynomial of lowest order.

     See also: *note conv: XREFconv, *note residue: XREFresidue.

 -- : conv2 (A, B)
 -- : conv2 (V1, V2, M)
 -- : conv2 (..., SHAPE)
     Return the 2-D convolution of A and B.

     The size of the result is determined by the optional SHAPE argument
     which takes the following values

     SHAPE = "full"
          Return the full convolution.  (default)

     SHAPE = "same"
          Return the central part of the convolution with the same size
          as A.  The central part of the convolution begins at the
          indices ‘floor ([size(B)/2] + 1)’.

     SHAPE = "valid"
          Return only the parts which do not include zero-padded edges.
          The size of the result is ‘max (size (A) - size (B) + 1, 0)’.

     When the third argument is a matrix, return the convolution of the
     matrix M by the vector V1 in the column direction and by the vector
     V2 in the row direction.

     See also: *note conv: XREFconv, *note convn: XREFconvn.

 -- : Q = polygcd (B, A)
 -- : Q = polygcd (B, A, TOL)

     Find the greatest common divisor of two polynomials.

     This is equivalent to the polynomial found by multiplying together
     all the common roots.  Together with deconv, you can reduce a ratio
     of two polynomials.

     The tolerance TOL defaults to ‘sqrt (eps)’.

     *Caution:* This is a numerically unstable algorithm and should not
     be used on large polynomials.

     Example code:

          polygcd (poly (1:8), poly (3:12)) - poly (3:8)
          ⇒ [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ]
          deconv (poly (1:8), polygcd (poly (1:8), poly (3:12))) - poly (1:2)
          ⇒ [ 0, 0, 0 ]

     See also: *note poly: XREFpoly, *note roots: XREFroots, *note conv:
     XREFconv, *note deconv: XREFdeconv, *note residue: XREFresidue.

 -- : [R, P, K, E] = residue (B, A)
 -- : [B, A] = residue (R, P, K)
 -- : [B, A] = residue (R, P, K, E)
     The first calling form computes the partial fraction expansion for
     the quotient of the polynomials, B and A.

     The quotient is defined as

          B(s)    M       r(m)        N
          ---- = SUM ------------- + SUM k(i)*s^(N-i)
          A(s)   m=1 (s-p(m))^e(m)   i=1

     where M is the number of poles (the length of the R, P, and E), the
     K vector is a polynomial of order N-1 representing the direct
     contribution, and the E vector specifies the multiplicity of the
     m-th residue’s pole.

     For example,

          b = [1, 1, 1];
          a = [1, -5, 8, -4];
          [r, p, k, e] = residue (b, a)
             ⇒ r = [-2; 7; 3]
             ⇒ p = [2; 2; 1]
             ⇒ k = [](0x0)
             ⇒ e = [1; 2; 1]

     which represents the following partial fraction expansion

                  s^2 + s + 1       -2        7        3
             ------------------- = ----- + ------- + -----
             s^3 - 5s^2 + 8s - 4   (s-2)   (s-2)^2   (s-1)

     The second calling form performs the inverse operation and computes
     the reconstituted quotient of polynomials, B(s)/A(s), from the
     partial fraction expansion; represented by the residues, poles, and
     a direct polynomial specified by R, P and K, and the pole
     multiplicity E.

     If the multiplicity, E, is not explicitly specified the
     multiplicity is determined by the function ‘mpoles’.

     For example:

          r = [-2; 7; 3];
          p = [2; 2; 1];
          k = [1, 0];
          [b, a] = residue (r, p, k)
             ⇒ b = [1, -5, 9, -3, 1]
             ⇒ a = [1, -5, 8, -4]

          where mpoles is used to determine e = [1; 2; 1]

     Alternatively the multiplicity may be defined explicitly, for
     example,

          r = [7; 3; -2];
          p = [2; 1; 2];
          k = [1, 0];
          e = [2; 1; 1];
          [b, a] = residue (r, p, k, e)
             ⇒ b = [1, -5, 9, -3, 1]
             ⇒ a = [1, -5, 8, -4]

     which represents the following partial fraction expansion

           -2        7        3         s^4 - 5s^3 + 9s^2 - 3s + 1
          ----- + ------- + ----- + s = --------------------------
          (s-2)   (s-2)^2   (s-1)          s^3 - 5s^2 + 8s - 4

28.4 Derivatives / Integrals / Transforms
=========================================

Octave comes with functions for computing the derivative and the
integral of a polynomial.  The functions ‘polyder’ and ‘polyint’ both
return new polynomials describing the result.  As an example we’ll
compute the definite integral of p(x) = x^2 + 1 from 0 to 3.

     c = [1, 0, 1];
     integral = polyint (c);
     area = polyval (integral, 3) - polyval (integral, 0)
     ⇒ 12

 -- : polyder (P)
 -- : [K] = polyder (A, B)
 -- : [Q, D] = polyder (B, A)
     Return the coefficients of the derivative of the polynomial whose
     coefficients are given by the vector P.

     If a pair of polynomials is given, return the derivative of the
     product A*B.

     If two inputs and two outputs are given, return the derivative of
     the polynomial quotient B/A.  The quotient numerator is in Q and
     the denominator in D.

     See also: *note polyint: XREFpolyint, *note polyval: XREFpolyval,
     *note polyreduce: XREFpolyreduce.

 -- : polyint (P)
 -- : polyint (P, K)
     Return the coefficients of the integral of the polynomial whose
     coefficients are represented by the vector P.

     The variable K is the constant of integration, which by default is
     set to zero.

     See also: *note polyder: XREFpolyder, *note polyval: XREFpolyval.

 -- : polyaffine (F, MU)
     Return the coefficients of the polynomial vector F after an affine
     transformation.

     If F is the vector representing the polynomial f(x), then ‘G =
     polyaffine (F, MU)’ is the vector representing:

          g(x) = f( (x - MU(1)) / MU(2) )

28.5 Polynomial Interpolation
=============================

Octave comes with good support for various kinds of interpolation, most
of which are described in *note Interpolation::.  One simple alternative
to the functions described in the aforementioned chapter, is to fit a
single polynomial, or a piecewise polynomial (spline) to some given data
points.  To avoid a highly fluctuating polynomial, one most often wants
to fit a low-order polynomial to data.  This usually means that it is
necessary to fit the polynomial in a least-squares sense, which just is
what the ‘polyfit’ function does.

 -- : P = polyfit (X, Y, N)
 -- : [P, S] = polyfit (X, Y, N)
 -- : [P, S, MU] = polyfit (X, Y, N)
     Return the coefficients of a polynomial P(X) of degree N that
     minimizes the least-squares-error of the fit to the points ‘[X,
     Y]’.

     If N is a logical vector, it is used as a mask to selectively force
     the corresponding polynomial coefficients to be used or ignored.

     The polynomial coefficients are returned in a row vector.

     The optional output S is a structure containing the following
     fields:

     ‘R’
          Triangular factor R from the QR decomposition.

     ‘X’
          The Vandermonde matrix used to compute the polynomial
          coefficients.

     ‘C’
          The unscaled covariance matrix, formally equal to the inverse
          of X’*X, but computed in a way minimizing roundoff error
          propagation.

     ‘df’
          The degrees of freedom.

     ‘normr’
          The norm of the residuals.

     ‘yf’
          The values of the polynomial for each value of X.

     The second output may be used by ‘polyval’ to calculate the
     statistical error limits of the predicted values.  In particular,
     the standard deviation of P coefficients is given by

     ‘sqrt (diag (s.C)/s.df)*s.normr’.

     When the third output, MU, is present the coefficients, P, are
     associated with a polynomial in

     ‘XHAT = (X - MU(1)) / MU(2)’
     where MU(1) = mean (X), and MU(2) = std (X).

     This linear transformation of X improves the numerical stability of
     the fit.

     See also: *note polyval: XREFpolyval, *note polyaffine:
     XREFpolyaffine, *note roots: XREFroots, *note vander: XREFvander,
     *note zscore: XREFzscore.

   In situations where a single polynomial isn’t good enough, a solution
is to use several polynomials pieced together.  The function ‘splinefit’
fits a piecewise polynomial (spline) to a set of data.

 -- : PP = splinefit (X, Y, BREAKS)
 -- : PP = splinefit (X, Y, P)
 -- : PP = splinefit (..., "periodic", PERIODIC)
 -- : PP = splinefit (..., "robust", ROBUST)
 -- : PP = splinefit (..., "beta", BETA)
 -- : PP = splinefit (..., "order", ORDER)
 -- : PP = splinefit (..., "constraints", CONSTRAINTS)

     Fit a piecewise cubic spline with breaks (knots) BREAKS to the
     noisy data, X and Y.

     X is a vector, and Y is a vector or N-D array.  If Y is an N-D
     array, then X(j) is matched to Y(:,...,:,j).

     P is a positive integer defining the number of intervals along X,
     and P+1 is the number of breaks.  The number of points in each
     interval differ by no more than 1.

     The optional property PERIODIC is a logical value which specifies
     whether a periodic boundary condition is applied to the spline.
     The length of the period is ‘max (BREAKS) - min (BREAKS)’.  The
     default value is ‘false’.

     The optional property ROBUST is a logical value which specifies if
     robust fitting is to be applied to reduce the influence of outlying
     data points.  Three iterations of weighted least squares are
     performed.  Weights are computed from previous residuals.  The
     sensitivity of outlier identification is controlled by the property
     BETA.  The value of BETA is restricted to the range, 0 < BETA < 1.
     The default value is BETA = 1/2.  Values close to 0 give all data
     equal weighting.  Increasing values of BETA reduce the influence of
     outlying data.  Values close to unity may cause instability or rank
     deficiency.

     The fitted spline is returned as a piecewise polynomial, PP, and
     may be evaluated using ‘ppval’.

     The splines are constructed of polynomials with degree ORDER.  The
     default is a cubic, ORDER=3.  A spline with P pieces has P+ORDER
     degrees of freedom.  With periodic boundary conditions the degrees
     of freedom are reduced to P.

     The optional property, CONSTAINTS, is a structure specifying linear
     constraints on the fit.  The structure has three fields, "xc",
     "yc", and "cc".

     "xc"
          Vector of the x-locations of the constraints.

     "yc"
          Constraining values at the locations XC.  The default is an
          array of zeros.

     "cc"
          Coefficients (matrix).  The default is an array of ones.  The
          number of rows is limited to the order of the piecewise
          polynomials, ORDER.

     Constraints are linear combinations of derivatives of order 0 to
     ORDER-1 according to

          cc(1,j) * y(xc(j)) + cc(2,j) * y'(xc(j)) + ... = yc(:,...,:,j).

     XREFpchip, *note ppder: XREFppder, *note ppint: XREFppint, *note
     ppjumps: XREFppjumps.

   The number of BREAKS (or knots) used to construct the piecewise
polynomial is a significant factor in suppressing the noise present in
the input data, X and Y.  This is demonstrated by the example below.

     x = 2 * pi * rand (1, 200);
     y = sin (x) + sin (2 * x) + 0.2 * randn (size (x));
     ## Uniform breaks
     breaks = linspace (0, 2 * pi, 41); % 41 breaks, 40 pieces
     pp1 = splinefit (x, y, breaks);
     ## Breaks interpolated from data
     pp2 = splinefit (x, y, 10);  % 11 breaks, 10 pieces
     ## Plot
     xx = linspace (0, 2 * pi, 400);
     y1 = ppval (pp1, xx);
     y2 = ppval (pp2, xx);
     plot (x, y, ".", xx, [y1; y2])
     axis tight
     ylim auto
     legend ({"data", "41 breaks, 40 pieces", "11 breaks, 10 pieces"})

   The piecewise polynomial fit, provided by ‘splinefit’, has continuous
derivatives up to the ORDER-1.  For example, a cubic fit has continuous
first and second derivatives.  This is demonstrated by the code

     ## Data (200 points)
     x = 2 * pi * rand (1, 200);
     y = sin (x) + sin (2 * x) + 0.1 * randn (size (x));
     ## Piecewise constant
     pp1 = splinefit (x, y, 8, "order", 0);
     ## Piecewise linear
     pp2 = splinefit (x, y, 8, "order", 1);
     ## Piecewise quadratic
     pp3 = splinefit (x, y, 8, "order", 2);
     ## Piecewise cubic
     pp4 = splinefit (x, y, 8, "order", 3);
     ## Piecewise quartic
     pp5 = splinefit (x, y, 8, "order", 4);
     ## Plot
     xx = linspace (0, 2 * pi, 400);
     y1 = ppval (pp1, xx);
     y2 = ppval (pp2, xx);
     y3 = ppval (pp3, xx);
     y4 = ppval (pp4, xx);
     y5 = ppval (pp5, xx);
     plot (x, y, ".", xx, [y1; y2; y3; y4; y5])
     axis tight
     ylim auto
     legend ({"data", "order 0", "order 1", "order 2", "order 3", "order 4"})

   When the underlying function to provide a fit to is periodic,
‘splinefit’ is able to apply the boundary conditions needed to manifest
a periodic fit.  This is demonstrated by the code below.

     ## Data (100 points)
     x = 2 * pi * [0, (rand (1, 98)), 1];
     y = sin (x) - cos (2 * x) + 0.2 * randn (size (x));
     ## No constraints
     pp1 = splinefit (x, y, 10, "order", 5);
     ## Periodic boundaries
     pp2 = splinefit (x, y, 10, "order", 5, "periodic", true);
     ## Plot
     xx = linspace (0, 2 * pi, 400);
     y1 = ppval (pp1, xx);
     y2 = ppval (pp2, xx);
     plot (x, y, ".", xx, [y1; y2])
     axis tight
     ylim auto
     legend ({"data", "no constraints", "periodic"})

   More complex constraints may be added as well.  For example, the code
below illustrates a periodic fit with values that have been clamped at
the endpoints, and a second periodic fit which is hinged at the
endpoints.

     ## Data (200 points)
     x = 2 * pi * rand (1, 200);
     y = sin (2 * x) + 0.1 * randn (size (x));
     ## Breaks
     breaks = linspace (0, 2 * pi, 10);
     ## Clamped endpoints, y = y' = 0
     xc = [0, 0, 2*pi, 2*pi];
     cc = [(eye (2)), (eye (2))];
     con = struct ("xc", xc, "cc", cc);
     pp1 = splinefit (x, y, breaks, "constraints", con);
     ## Hinged periodic endpoints, y = 0
     con = struct ("xc", 0);
     pp2 = splinefit (x, y, breaks, "constraints", con, "periodic", true);
     ## Plot
     xx = linspace (0, 2 * pi, 400);
     y1 = ppval (pp1, xx);
     y2 = ppval (pp2, xx);
     plot (x, y, ".", xx, [y1; y2])
     axis tight
     ylim auto
     legend ({"data", "clamped", "hinged periodic"})

   The ‘splinefit’ function also provides the convenience of a ROBUST
fitting, where the effect of outlying data is reduced.  In the example
below, three different fits are provided.  Two with differing levels of
outlier suppression and a third illustrating the non-robust solution.

     ## Data
     x = linspace (0, 2*pi, 200);
     y = sin (x) + sin (2 * x) + 0.05 * randn (size (x));
     ## Add outliers
     x = [x, linspace(0,2*pi,60)];
     y = [y, -ones(1,60)];
     ## Fit splines with hinged conditions
     con = struct ("xc", [0, 2*pi]);
     ## Robust fitting, beta = 0.25
     pp1 = splinefit (x, y, 8, "constraints", con, "beta", 0.25);
     ## Robust fitting, beta = 0.75
     pp2 = splinefit (x, y, 8, "constraints", con, "beta", 0.75);
     ## No robust fitting
     pp3 = splinefit (x, y, 8, "constraints", con);
     ## Plot
     xx = linspace (0, 2*pi, 400);
     y1 = ppval (pp1, xx);
     y2 = ppval (pp2, xx);
     y3 = ppval (pp3, xx);
     plot (x, y, ".", xx, [y1; y2; y3])
     legend ({"data with outliers","robust, beta = 0.25", ...
              "robust, beta = 0.75", "no robust fitting"})
     axis tight
     ylim auto

   A very specific form of polynomial interpretation is the Padé
approximant.  For control systems, a continuous-time delay can be
modeled very simply with the approximant.

 -- : [NUM, DEN] = padecoef (T)
 -- : [NUM, DEN] = padecoef (T, N)
     Compute the Nth-order Padé approximant of the continuous-time delay
     T in transfer function form.

     The Padé approximant of ‘exp (-sT)’ is defined by the following
     equation

                       Pn(s)
          exp (-sT) ~ -------
                       Qn(s)

     Where both Pn(s) and Qn(s) are Nth-order rational functions defined
     by the following expressions

                   N    (2N - k)!N!        k
          Pn(s) = SUM --------------- (-sT)
                  k=0 (2N)!k!(N - k)!

          Qn(s) = Pn(-s)

     The inputs T and N must be non-negative numeric scalars.  If N is
     unspecified it defaults to 1.

     The output row vectors NUM and DEN contain the numerator and
     denominator coefficients in descending powers of s.  Both are
     Nth-order polynomials.

     For example:

          t = 0.1;
          n = 4;
          [num, den] = padecoef (t, n)
          ⇒ num =

                1.0000e-04  -2.0000e-02   1.8000e+00  -8.4000e+01   1.6800e+03

          ⇒ den =

                1.0000e-04   2.0000e-02   1.8000e+00   8.4000e+01   1.6800e+03

   The function, ‘ppval’, evaluates the piecewise polynomials, created
by ‘mkpp’ or other means, and ‘unmkpp’ returns detailed information
about the piecewise polynomial.

   The following example shows how to combine two linear functions and a
quadratic into one function.  Each of these functions is expressed on
adjoined intervals.

     x = [-2, -1, 1, 2];
     p = [ 0,  1, 0;
           1, -2, 1;
           0, -1, 1 ];
     pp = mkpp (x, p);
     xi = linspace (-2, 2, 50);
     yi = ppval (pp, xi);
     plot (xi, yi);

 -- : PP = mkpp (BREAKS, COEFS)
 -- : PP = mkpp (BREAKS, COEFS, D)

     Construct a piecewise polynomial (pp) structure from sample points
     BREAKS and coefficients COEFS.

     BREAKS must be a vector of strictly increasing values.  The number
     of intervals is given by ‘NI = length (BREAKS) - 1’.

     When M is the polynomial order COEFS must be of size: NI x M + 1.

     The i-th row of COEFS, ‘COEFS (I,:)’, contains the coefficients for
     the polynomial over the I-th interval, ordered from highest (M) to
     lowest (0).

     COEFS may also be a multi-dimensional array, specifying a
     vector-valued or array-valued polynomial.  In that case the
     polynomial order is defined by the length of the last dimension of
     COEFS.  The size of first dimension(s) are given by the scalar or
     vector D.  If D is not given it is set to ‘1’.  In any case COEFS
     is reshaped to a 2-D matrix of size ‘[NI*prod(D M)]’.

     The components are:

     X
          Sample points.

     P
          Polynomial coefficients for points in sample interval.  ‘P (I,
          :)’ contains the coefficients for the polynomial over interval
          I ordered from highest to lowest.  If ‘D > 1’, ‘P (R, I, :)’
          contains the coefficients for the r-th polynomial defined on
          interval I.

     N
          Number of polynomial pieces.

     K
          Order of the polynomial plus 1.

     D
          Number of polynomials defined for each interval.

 -- : YI = ppval (PP, XI)
     Evaluate the piecewise polynomial structure PP at the points XI.

     If PP describes a scalar polynomial function, the result is an
     array of the same shape as XI.  Otherwise, the size of the result
     is ‘[pp.dim, length(XI)]’ if XI is a vector, or ‘[pp.dim,
     size(XI)]’ if it is a multi-dimensional array.

28.6 Miscellaneous Functions
============================

 -- : poly (A)
 -- : poly (X)
     If A is a square N-by-N matrix, ‘poly (A)’ is the row vector of the
     coefficients of ‘det (z * eye (N) - A)’, the characteristic
     polynomial of A.

     For example, the following code finds the eigenvalues of A which
     are the roots of ‘poly (A)’.

          roots (poly (eye (3)))
              ⇒ 1.00001 + 0.00001i
                 1.00001 - 0.00001i
                 0.99999 + 0.00000i

     In fact, all three eigenvalues are exactly 1 which emphasizes that
     for numerical performance the ‘eig’ function should be used to
     compute eigenvalues.

     If X is a vector, ‘poly (X)’ is a vector of the coefficients of the
     polynomial whose roots are the elements of X.  That is, if C is a
     polynomial, then the elements of ‘D = roots (poly (C))’ are
     contained in C.  The vectors C and D are not identical, however,
     due to sorting and numerical errors.

     See also: *note roots: XREFroots, *note eig: XREFeig.

 -- : polyout (C)
 -- : polyout (C, X)
 -- : STR = polyout (...)
     Display a formatted version of the polynomial C.

     The formatted polynomial

          c(x) = c(1) * x^n + ... + c(n) x + c(n+1)

     is returned as a string or written to the screen if ‘nargout’ is
     zero.

     The second argument X specifies the variable name to use for each
     term and defaults to the string "s".

     See also: *note polyreduce: XREFpolyreduce.

 -- : polyreduce (C)
     Reduce a polynomial coefficient vector to a minimum number of terms
     by stripping off any leading zeros.

29.1 One-dimensional Interpolation
==================================

Octave supports several methods for one-dimensional interpolation, most
of which are described in this section.  *note Polynomial
Interpolation:: and *note Interpolation on Scattered Data:: describe
additional methods.

 -- : YI = interp1 (X, Y, XI)
 -- : YI = interp1 (Y, XI)
 -- : YI = interp1 (..., METHOD)
 -- : YI = interp1 (..., EXTRAP)
 -- : YI = interp1 (..., "left")
 -- : YI = interp1 (..., "right")
 -- : PP = interp1 (..., "pp")

     One-dimensional interpolation.

     Interpolate input data to determine the value of YI at the points
     XI.  If not specified, X is taken to be the indices of Y (‘1:length
     (Y)’).  If Y is a matrix or an N-dimensional array, the
     interpolation is performed on each column of Y.

     The interpolation METHOD is one of:

     "nearest"
          Return the nearest neighbor.

     "previous"
          Return the previous neighbor.

     "next"
          Return the next neighbor.

     "linear" (default)
          Linear interpolation from nearest neighbors.

     "pchip"
          Piecewise cubic Hermite interpolating
          polynomial—shape-preserving interpolation with smooth first
          derivative.

     "cubic"
          Cubic interpolation (same as "pchip").

     "spline"
          Cubic spline interpolation—smooth first and second derivatives
          throughout the curve.

     Adding ’*’ to the start of any method above forces ‘interp1’ to
     assume that X is uniformly spaced, and only ‘X(1)’ and ‘X(2)’ are
     referenced.  This is usually faster, and is never slower.  The
     default method is "linear".

     If EXTRAP is the string "extrap", then extrapolate values beyond
     the endpoints using the current METHOD.  If EXTRAP is a number,
     then replace values beyond the endpoints with that number.  When
     unspecified, EXTRAP defaults to ‘NA’.

     If the string argument "pp" is specified, then XI should not be
     supplied and ‘interp1’ returns a piecewise polynomial object.  This
     object can later be used with ‘ppval’ to evaluate the
     interpolation.  There is an equivalence, such that ‘ppval (interp1
     (X, Y, METHOD, "pp"), XI) == interp1 (X, Y, XI, METHOD, "extrap")’.

     Duplicate points in X specify a discontinuous interpolant.  There
     may be at most 2 consecutive points with the same value.  If X is
     increasing, the default discontinuous interpolant is
     right-continuous.  If X is decreasing, the default discontinuous
     interpolant is left-continuous.  The continuity condition of the
     interpolant may be specified by using the options "left" or "right"
     to select a left-continuous or right-continuous interpolant,
     respectively.  Discontinuous interpolation is only allowed for
     "nearest" and "linear" methods; in all other cases, the X-values
     must be unique.

     An example of the use of ‘interp1’ is

          xf = [0:0.05:10];
          yf = sin (2*pi*xf/5);
          xp = [0:10];
          yp = sin (2*pi*xp/5);
          lin = interp1 (xp, yp, xf);
          near = interp1 (xp, yp, xf, "nearest");
          pch = interp1 (xp, yp, xf, "pchip");
          spl = interp1 (xp, yp, xf, "spline");
          plot (xf,yf,"r", xf,near,"g", xf,lin,"b", xf,pch,"c", xf,spl,"m",
                xp,yp,"r*");
          legend ("original", "nearest", "linear", "pchip", "spline");

     See also: *note pchip: XREFpchip, *note spline: XREFspline, *note
     interpft: XREFinterpft, *note interp2: XREFinterp2, *note interp3:
     XREFinterp3, *note interpn: XREFinterpn.

   There are some important differences between the various
interpolation methods.  The "spline" method enforces that both the first
and second derivatives of the interpolated values have a continuous
derivative, whereas the other methods do not.  This means that the
results of the "spline" method are generally smoother.  If the function
to be interpolated is in fact smooth, then "spline" will give excellent
results.  However, if the function to be evaluated is in some manner
discontinuous, then "pchip" interpolation might give better results.

   This can be demonstrated by the code

     t = -2:2;
     dt = 1;
     ti =-2:0.025:2;
     dti = 0.025;
     y = sign (t);
     ys = interp1 (t,y,ti,"spline");
     yp = interp1 (t,y,ti,"pchip");
     ddys = diff (diff (ys)./dti) ./ dti;
     ddyp = diff (diff (yp)./dti) ./ dti;
     figure (1);
     plot (ti,ys,"r-", ti,yp,"g-");
     legend ("spline", "pchip", 4);
     figure (2);
     plot (ti,ddys,"r+", ti,ddyp,"g*");
     legend ("spline", "pchip");

   Fourier interpolation, is a resampling technique where a signal is
converted to the frequency domain, padded with zeros and then
reconverted to the time domain.

 -- : interpft (X, N)
 -- : interpft (X, N, DIM)

     Fourier interpolation.

     If X is a vector then X is resampled with N points.  The data in X
     is assumed to be equispaced.  If X is a matrix or an N-dimensional
     array, the interpolation is performed on each column of X.

     If DIM is specified, then interpolate along the dimension DIM.

     ‘interpft’ assumes that the interpolated function is periodic, and
     so assumptions are made about the endpoints of the interpolation.

     See also: *note interp1: XREFinterp1.

   There are two significant limitations on Fourier interpolation.
First, the function signal is assumed to be periodic, and so
non-periodic signals will be poorly represented at the edges.  Second,
both the signal and its interpolation are required to be sampled at
equispaced points.  An example of the use of ‘interpft’ is

     t = 0 : 0.3 : pi; dt = t(2)-t(1);
     n = length (t); k = 100;
     ti = t(1) + [0 : k-1]*dt*n/k;
     y = sin (4*t + 0.3) .* cos (3*t - 0.1);
     yp = sin (4*ti + 0.3) .* cos (3*ti - 0.1);
     plot (ti, yp, "g", ti, interp1 (t, y, ti, "spline"), "b", ...
           ti, interpft (y, k), "c", t, y, "r+");
     legend ("sin(4t+0.3)cos(3t-0.1)", "spline", "interpft", "data");

which demonstrates the poor behavior of Fourier interpolation for
non-periodic functions.

   In addition, the support functions ‘spline’ and ‘lookup’ that
underlie the ‘interp1’ function can be called directly.

 -- : PP = spline (X, Y)
 -- : YI = spline (X, Y, XI)
     Return the cubic spline interpolant of points X and Y.

     When called with two arguments, return the piecewise polynomial PP
     that may be used with ‘ppval’ to evaluate the polynomial at
     specific points.

     When called with a third input argument, ‘spline’ evaluates the
     spline at the points XI.  The third calling form ‘spline (X, Y,
     XI)’ is equivalent to ‘ppval (spline (X, Y), XI)’.

     The variable X must be a vector of length N.

     Y can be either a vector or array.  If Y is a vector it must have a
     length of either N or ‘N + 2’.  If the length of Y is N, then the
     "not-a-knot" end condition is used.  If the length of Y is ‘N + 2’,
     then the first and last values of the vector Y are the values of
     the first derivative of the cubic spline at the endpoints.

     If Y is an array, then the size of Y must have the form ‘[S1, S2,
     ..., SK, N]’ or ‘[S1, S2, ..., SK, N + 2]’.  The array is reshaped
     internally to a matrix where the leading dimension is given by ‘S1
     * S2 * ... * SK’ and each row of this matrix is then treated
     separately.  Note that this is exactly the opposite of ‘interp1’
     but is done for MATLAB compatibility.

29.2 Multi-dimensional Interpolation
====================================

There are three multi-dimensional interpolation functions in Octave,
with similar capabilities.  Methods using Delaunay tessellation are
described in *note Interpolation on Scattered Data::.

 -- : ZI = interp2 (X, Y, Z, XI, YI)
 -- : ZI = interp2 (Z, XI, YI)
 -- : ZI = interp2 (Z, N)
 -- : ZI = interp2 (Z)
 -- : ZI = interp2 (..., METHOD)
 -- : ZI = interp2 (..., METHOD, EXTRAP)

     Two-dimensional interpolation.

     Interpolate reference data X, Y, Z to determine ZI at the
     coordinates XI, YI.  The reference data X, Y can be matrices, as
     returned by ‘meshgrid’, in which case the sizes of X, Y, and Z must
     be equal.  If X, Y are vectors describing a grid then ‘length (X)
     == columns (Z)’ and ‘length (Y) == rows (Z)’.  In either case the
     input data must be strictly monotonic.

     If called without X, Y, and just a single reference data matrix Z,
     the 2-D region ‘X = 1:columns (Z), Y = 1:rows (Z)’ is assumed.
     This saves memory if the grid is regular and the distance between
     points is not important.

     If called with a single reference data matrix Z and a refinement
     value N, then perform interpolation over a grid where each original
     interval has been recursively subdivided N times.  This results in
     ‘2^N-1’ additional points for every interval in the original grid.
     If N is omitted a value of 1 is used.  As an example, the interval
     [0,1] with ‘N==2’ results in a refined interval with points at [0,
     1/4, 1/2, 3/4, 1].

     The interpolation METHOD is one of:

     "nearest"
          Return the nearest neighbor.

     "linear" (default)
          Linear interpolation from nearest neighbors.

     "pchip"
          Piecewise cubic Hermite interpolating
          polynomial—shape-preserving interpolation with smooth first
          derivative.

     "cubic"
          Cubic interpolation (same as "pchip").

     "spline"
          Cubic spline interpolation—smooth first and second derivatives
          throughout the curve.

     EXTRAP is a scalar number.  It replaces values beyond the endpoints
     with EXTRAP.  Note that if EXTRAPVAL is used, METHOD must be
     specified as well.  If EXTRAP is omitted and the METHOD is
     "spline", then the extrapolated values of the "spline" are used.
     Otherwise the default EXTRAP value for any other METHOD is "NA".

     See also: *note interp1: XREFinterp1, *note interp3: XREFinterp3,
     *note interpn: XREFinterpn, *note meshgrid: XREFmeshgrid.

 -- : VI = interp3 (X, Y, Z, V, XI, YI, ZI)
 -- : VI = interp3 (V, XI, YI, ZI)
 -- : VI = interp3 (V, N)
 -- : VI = interp3 (V)
 -- : VI = interp3 (..., METHOD)
 -- : VI = interp3 (..., METHOD, EXTRAPVAL)

     Three-dimensional interpolation.

     Interpolate reference data X, Y, Z, V to determine VI at the
     coordinates XI, YI, ZI.  The reference data X, Y, Z can be
     matrices, as returned by ‘meshgrid’, in which case the sizes of X,
     Y, Z, and V must be equal.  If X, Y, Z are vectors describing a
     cubic grid then ‘length (X) == columns (V)’, ‘length (Y) == rows
     (V)’, and ‘length (Z) == size (V, 3)’.  In either case the input
     data must be strictly monotonic.

     If called without X, Y, Z, and just a single reference data matrix
     V, the 3-D region ‘X = 1:columns (V), Y = 1:rows (V), Z = 1:size
     (V, 3)’ is assumed.  This saves memory if the grid is regular and
     the distance between points is not important.

     If called with a single reference data matrix V and a refinement
     value N, then perform interpolation over a 3-D grid where each
     original interval has been recursively subdivided N times.  This
     results in ‘2^N-1’ additional points for every interval in the
     original grid.  If N is omitted a value of 1 is used.  As an
     example, the interval [0,1] with ‘N==2’ results in a refined
     interval with points at [0, 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, 1].

     The interpolation METHOD is one of:

     "nearest"
          Return the nearest neighbor.

     "linear" (default)
          Linear interpolation from nearest neighbors.

     "cubic"
          Piecewise cubic Hermite interpolating
          polynomial—shape-preserving interpolation with smooth first
          derivative (not implemented yet).

     "spline"
          Cubic spline interpolation—smooth first and second derivatives
          throughout the curve.

     EXTRAPVAL is a scalar number.  It replaces values beyond the
     endpoints with EXTRAPVAL.  Note that if EXTRAPVAL is used, METHOD
     must be specified as well.  If EXTRAPVAL is omitted and the METHOD
     is "spline", then the extrapolated values of the "spline" are used.
     Otherwise the default EXTRAPVAL value for any other METHOD is "NA".

 -- : VI = interpn (V, Y1, Y2, ...)
 -- : VI = interpn (V, M)
 -- : VI = interpn (V)
 -- : VI = interpn (..., METHOD)
 -- : VI = interpn (..., METHOD, EXTRAPVAL)

     Perform N-dimensional interpolation, where N is at least two.

     Each element of the N-dimensional array V represents a value at a
     location given by the parameters X1, X2, ..., XN.  The parameters
     X1, X2, ..., XN are either N-dimensional arrays of the same size as
     the array V in the "ndgrid" format or vectors.  The parameters Y1,
     etc.  respect a similar format to X1, etc., and they represent the
     points at which the array VI is interpolated.

     If X1, ..., XN are omitted, they are assumed to be ‘x1 = 1 : size
     (V, 1)’, etc.  If M is specified, then the interpolation adds a
     point half way between each of the interpolation points.  This
     process is performed M times.  If only V is specified, then M is
     assumed to be ‘1’.

     The interpolation METHOD is one of:

     "nearest"
          Return the nearest neighbor.

     "linear" (default)
          Linear interpolation from nearest neighbors.

     "pchip"
          Piecewise cubic Hermite interpolating
          polynomial—shape-preserving interpolation with smooth first
          derivative (not implemented yet).

     "cubic"
          Cubic interpolation (same as "pchip" [not implemented yet]).

     "spline"
          Cubic spline interpolation—smooth first and second derivatives
          throughout the curve.

     The default method is "linear".

     EXTRAPVAL is a scalar number.  It replaces values beyond the
     endpoints with EXTRAPVAL.  Note that if EXTRAPVAL is used, METHOD
     must be specified as well.  If EXTRAPVAL is omitted and the METHOD
     is "spline", then the extrapolated values of the "spline" are used.
     Otherwise the default EXTRAPVAL value for any other METHOD is "NA".

     See also: *note interp1: XREFinterp1, *note interp2: XREFinterp2,
     *note interp3: XREFinterp3, *note spline: XREFspline, *note ndgrid:
     XREFndgrid.

   A significant difference between ‘interpn’ and the other two
multi-dimensional interpolation functions is the fashion in which the
dimensions are treated.  For ‘interp2’ and ‘interp3’, the y-axis is
considered to be the columns of the matrix, whereas the x-axis
corresponds to the rows of the array.  As Octave indexes arrays in
column major order, the first dimension of any array is the columns, and
so ‘interpn’ effectively reverses the ’x’ and ’y’ dimensions.  Consider
the example,

     x = y = z = -1:1;
     f = @(x,y,z) x.^2 - y - z.^2;
     [xx, yy, zz] = meshgrid (x, y, z);
     v = f (xx,yy,zz);
     xi = yi = zi = -1:0.1:1;
     [xxi, yyi, zzi] = meshgrid (xi, yi, zi);
     vi = interp3 (x, y, z, v, xxi, yyi, zzi, "spline");
     [xxi, yyi, zzi] = ndgrid (xi, yi, zi);
     vi2 = interpn (x, y, z, v, xxi, yyi, zzi, "spline");
     mesh (zi, yi, squeeze (vi2(1,:,:)));

where ‘vi’ and ‘vi2’ are identical.  The reversal of the dimensions is
treated in the ‘meshgrid’ and ‘ndgrid’ functions respectively.

30.1 Delaunay Triangulation
===========================

The Delaunay triangulation is constructed from a set of circum-circles.
These circum-circles are chosen so that there are at least three of the
points in the set to triangulation on the circumference of the
circum-circle.  None of the points in the set of points falls within any
of the circum-circles.

   In general there are only three points on the circumference of any
circum-circle.  However, in some cases, and in particular for the case
of a regular grid, 4 or more points can be on a single circum-circle.
In this case the Delaunay triangulation is not unique.

 -- : TRI = delaunay (X, Y)
 -- : TETR = delaunay (X, Y, Z)
 -- : TRI = delaunay (X)
 -- : TRI = delaunay (..., OPTIONS)
     Compute the Delaunay triangulation for a 2-D or 3-D set of points.

     For 2-D sets, the return value TRI is a set of triangles which
     satisfies the Delaunay circum-circle criterion, i.e., only a single
     data point from [X, Y] is within the circum-circle of the defining
     triangle.  The set of triangles TRI is a matrix of size [n, 3].
     Each row defines a triangle and the three columns are the three
     vertices of the triangle.  The value of ‘TRI(i,j)’ is an index into
     X and Y for the location of the j-th vertex of the i-th triangle.

     For 3-D sets, the return value TETR is a set of tetrahedrons which
     satisfies the Delaunay circum-circle criterion, i.e., only a single
     data point from [X, Y, Z] is within the circum-circle of the
     defining tetrahedron.  The set of tetrahedrons is a matrix of size
     [n, 4].  Each row defines a tetrahedron and the four columns are
     the four vertices of the tetrahedron.  The value of ‘TETR(i,j)’ is
     an index into X, Y, Z for the location of the j-th vertex of the
     i-th tetrahedron.

     The input X may also be a matrix with two or three columns where
     the first column contains x-data, the second y-data, and the
     optional third column contains z-data.

     The optional last argument, which must be a string or cell array of
     strings, contains options passed to the underlying qhull command.
     See the documentation for the Qhull library for details
     <http://www.qhull.org/html/qh-quick.htm#options>.  The default
     options are ‘{"Qt", "Qbb", "Qc", "Qz"}’.

     If OPTIONS is not present or ‘[]’ then the default arguments are
     used.  Otherwise, OPTIONS replaces the default argument list.  To
     append user options to the defaults it is necessary to repeat the
     default arguments in OPTIONS.  Use a null string to pass no
     arguments.

          x = rand (1, 10);
          y = rand (1, 10);
          tri = delaunay (x, y);
          triplot (tri, x, y);
          hold on;
          plot (x, y, "r*");
          axis ([0,1,0,1]);

     See also: *note delaunayn: XREFdelaunayn, *note convhull:
     XREFconvhull, *note voronoi: XREFvoronoi, *note triplot:
     XREFtriplot, *note trimesh: XREFtrimesh, *note tetramesh:
     XREFtetramesh, *note trisurf: XREFtrisurf.

   For 3-D inputs ‘delaunay’ returns a set of tetrahedra that satisfy
the Delaunay circum-circle criteria.  Similarly, ‘delaunayn’ returns the
N-dimensional simplex satisfying the Delaunay circum-circle criteria.
The N-dimensional extension of a triangulation is called a tessellation.

 -- : T = delaunayn (PTS)
 -- : T = delaunayn (PTS, OPTIONS)
     Compute the Delaunay triangulation for an N-dimensional set of
     points.

     The Delaunay triangulation is a tessellation of the convex hull of
     a set of points such that no N-sphere defined by the N-triangles
     contains any other points from the set.

     The input matrix PTS of size [n, dim] contains n points in a space
     of dimension dim.  The return matrix T has size [m, dim+1].  Each
     row of T contains a set of indices back into the original set of
     points PTS which describes a simplex of dimension dim.  For
     example, a 2-D simplex is a triangle and 3-D simplex is a
     tetrahedron.

     An optional second argument, which must be a string or cell array
     of strings, contains options passed to the underlying qhull
     command.  See the documentation for the Qhull library for details
     <http://www.qhull.org/html/qh-quick.htm#options>.  The default
     options depend on the dimension of the input:

        • 2-D and 3-D: OPTIONS = ‘{"Qt", "Qbb", "Qc", "Qz"}’

        • 4-D and higher: OPTIONS = ‘{"Qt", "Qbb", "Qc", "Qx"}’

     If OPTIONS is not present or ‘[]’ then the default arguments are
     used.  Otherwise, OPTIONS replaces the default argument list.  To
     append user options to the defaults it is necessary to repeat the
     default arguments in OPTIONS.  Use a null string to pass no
     arguments.

   An example of a Delaunay triangulation of a set of points is

     rand ("state", 2);
     x = rand (10, 1);
     y = rand (10, 1);
     T = delaunay (x, y);
     X = [ x(T(:,1)); x(T(:,2)); x(T(:,3)); x(T(:,1)) ];
     Y = [ y(T(:,1)); y(T(:,2)); y(T(:,3)); y(T(:,1)) ];
     axis ([0, 1, 0, 1]);
     plot (X, Y, "b", x, y, "r*");

30.1.1 Plotting the Triangulation
---------------------------------

Octave has the functions ‘triplot’, ‘trimesh’, and ‘trisurf’ to plot the
Delaunay triangulation of a 2-dimensional set of points.  ‘tetramesh’
will plot the triangulation of a 3-dimensional set of points.

 -- : triplot (TRI, X, Y)
 -- : triplot (TRI, X, Y, LINESPEC)
 -- : H = triplot (...)
     Plot a 2-D triangular mesh.

     TRI is typically the output of a Delaunay triangulation over the
     grid of X, Y.  Every row of TRI represents one triangle and
     contains three indices into [X, Y] which are the vertices of the
     triangles in the x-y plane.

     The linestyle to use for the plot can be defined with the argument
     LINESPEC of the same format as the ‘plot’ command.

     The optional return value H is a graphics handle to the created
     patch object.

     See also: *note plot: XREFplot, *note trimesh: XREFtrimesh, *note
     trisurf: XREFtrisurf, *note delaunay: XREFdelaunay.

 -- : trimesh (TRI, X, Y, Z, C)
 -- : trimesh (TRI, X, Y, Z)
 -- : trimesh (TRI, X, Y)
 -- : trimesh (..., PROP, VAL, ...)
 -- : H = trimesh (...)
     Plot a 3-D triangular wireframe mesh.

     In contrast to ‘mesh’, which plots a mesh using rectangles,
     ‘trimesh’ plots the mesh using triangles.

     TRI is typically the output of a Delaunay triangulation over the
     grid of X, Y.  Every row of TRI represents one triangle and
     contains three indices into [X, Y] which are the vertices of the
     triangles in the x-y plane.  Z determines the height above the
     plane of each vertex.  If no Z input is given then the triangles
     are plotted as a 2-D figure.

     The color of the trimesh is computed by linearly scaling the Z
     values to fit the range of the current colormap.  Use ‘caxis’
     and/or change the colormap to control the appearance.

     Optionally, the color of the mesh can be specified independently of
     Z by supplying a color matrix, C.  If Z has N elements, then C
     should be an Nx1 vector for colormap data or an Nx3 matrix for RGB
     data.

     Any property/value pairs are passed directly to the underlying
     patch object.

     The optional return value H is a graphics handle to the created
     patch object.

     XREFhidden.

 -- : trisurf (TRI, X, Y, Z, C)
 -- : trisurf (TRI, X, Y, Z)
 -- : trisurf (..., PROP, VAL, ...)
 -- : H = trisurf (...)
     Plot a 3-D triangular surface.

     In contrast to ‘surf’, which plots a surface mesh using rectangles,
     ‘trisurf’ plots the mesh using triangles.

     TRI is typically the output of a Delaunay triangulation over the
     grid of X, Y.  Every row of TRI represents one triangle and
     contains three indices into [X, Y] which are the vertices of the
     triangles in the x-y plane.  Z determines the height above the
     plane of each vertex.

     The color of the trimesh is computed by linearly scaling the Z
     values to fit the range of the current colormap.  Use ‘caxis’
     and/or change the colormap to control the appearance.

     Optionally, the color of the mesh can be specified independently of
     Z by supplying a color matrix, C.  If Z has N elements, then C
     should be an Nx1 vector for colormap data or an Nx3 matrix for RGB
     data.

     Any property/value pairs are passed directly to the underlying
     patch object.

     The optional return value H is a graphics handle to the created
     patch object.

     See also: *note surf: XREFsurf, *note triplot: XREFtriplot, *note
     trimesh: XREFtrimesh, *note delaunay: XREFdelaunay, *note patch:
     XREFpatch, *note shading: XREFshading.

 -- : tetramesh (T, X)
 -- : tetramesh (T, X, C)
 -- : tetramesh (..., PROPERTY, VAL, ...)
 -- : H = tetramesh (...)
     Display the tetrahedrons defined in the m-by-4 matrix T as 3-D
     patches.

     T is typically the output of a Delaunay triangulation of a 3-D set
     of points.  Every row of T contains four indices into the n-by-3
     matrix X of the vertices of a tetrahedron.  Every row in X
     represents one point in 3-D space.

     The vector C specifies the color of each tetrahedron as an index
     into the current colormap.  The default value is 1:m where m is the
     number of tetrahedrons; the indices are scaled to map to the full
     range of the colormap.  If there are more tetrahedrons than colors
     in the colormap then the values in C are cyclically repeated.

     Calling ‘tetramesh (..., "property", "value", ...)’ passes all
     property/value pairs directly to the patch function as additional
     arguments.

     The optional return value H is a vector of patch handles where each
     handle represents one tetrahedron in the order given by T.  A
     typical use case for H is to turn the respective patch "visible"
     property "on" or "off".

     Type ‘demo tetramesh’ to see examples on using ‘tetramesh’.

     See also: *note trimesh: XREFtrimesh, *note delaunay: XREFdelaunay,
     *note delaunayn: XREFdelaunayn, *note patch: XREFpatch.

   The difference between ‘triplot’, and ‘trimesh’ or ‘triplot’, is that
the former only plots the 2-dimensional triangulation itself, whereas
the second two plot the value of a function ‘f (X, Y)’.  An example of
the use of the ‘triplot’ function is

     rand ("state", 2)
     x = rand (20, 1);
     y = rand (20, 1);
     tri = delaunay (x, y);
     triplot (tri, x, y);

which plots the Delaunay triangulation of a set of random points in
2-dimensions.

30.1.2 Identifying Points in Triangulation
------------------------------------------

It is often necessary to identify whether a particular point in the
N-dimensional space is within the Delaunay tessellation of a set of
points in this N-dimensional space, and if so which N-simplex contains
the point and which point in the tessellation is closest to the desired
point.  The functions ‘tsearch’ and ‘dsearch’ perform this function in a
triangulation, and ‘tsearchn’ and ‘dsearchn’ in an N-dimensional
tessellation.

   To identify whether a particular point represented by a vector P
falls within one of the simplices of an N-simplex, we can write the
Cartesian coordinates of the point in a parametric form with respect to
the N-simplex.  This parametric form is called the Barycentric
Coordinates of the point.  If the points defining the N-simplex are
given by ‘N + 1’ vectors T(I,:), then the Barycentric coordinates
defining the point P are given by

     P = sum (BETA(1:N+1) * T(1:N+1),:)

where there are ‘N + 1’ values ‘BETA(I)’ that together as a vector
represent the Barycentric coordinates of the point P.  To ensure a
unique solution for the values of ‘BETA(I)’ an additional criteria of

     sum (BETA(1:N+1)) == 1

is imposed, and we can therefore write the above as

     P - T(end, :) = BETA(1:end-1) * (T(1:end-1, :)
           - ones (N, 1) * T(end, :)

Solving for BETA we can then write

     BETA(1:end-1) = (P - T(end, :)) / (T(1:end-1, :)
           - ones (N, 1) * T(end, :))
     BETA(end) = sum (BETA(1:end-1))

which gives the formula for the conversion of the Cartesian coordinates
of the point P to the Barycentric coordinates BETA.  An important
property of the Barycentric coordinates is that for all points in the
N-simplex

     0 <= BETA(I) <= 1

Therefore, the test in ‘tsearch’ and ‘tsearchn’ essentially only needs
to express each point in terms of the Barycentric coordinates of each of
the simplices of the N-simplex and test the values of BETA.  This is
exactly the implementation used in ‘tsearchn’.  ‘tsearch’ is optimized
for 2-dimensions and the Barycentric coordinates are not explicitly
formed.

 -- : IDX = tsearch (X, Y, T, XI, YI)
     Search for the enclosing Delaunay convex hull.

     For ‘T = delaunay (X, Y)’, finds the index in T containing the
     points ‘(XI, YI)’.  For points outside the convex hull, IDX is NaN.

     See also: *note delaunay: XREFdelaunay, *note delaunayn:
     XREFdelaunayn.

 -- : IDX = tsearchn (X, T, XI)
 -- : [IDX, P] = tsearchn (X, T, XI)
     Search for the enclosing Delaunay convex hull.

     For ‘T = delaunayn (X)’, finds the index in T containing the points
     XI.  For points outside the convex hull, IDX is NaN.

     If requested ‘tsearchn’ also returns the Barycentric coordinates P
     of the enclosing triangles.

     See also: *note delaunay: XREFdelaunay, *note delaunayn:
     XREFdelaunayn.

   An example of the use of ‘tsearch’ can be seen with the simple
triangulation

     X = [-1; -1; 1; 1];
     Y = [-1; 1; -1; 1];
     TRI = [1, 2, 3; 2, 3, 1];

consisting of two triangles defined by TRI.  We can then identify which
triangle a point falls in like

     tsearch (X, Y, TRI, -0.5, -0.5)
     ⇒ 1
     tsearch (X, Y, TRI, 0.5, 0.5)
     ⇒ 2

and we can confirm that a point doesn’t lie within one of the triangles
like

     tsearch (X, Y, TRI, 2, 2)
     ⇒ NaN

   The ‘dsearch’ and ‘dsearchn’ find the closest point in a tessellation
to the desired point.  The desired point does not necessarily have to be
in the tessellation, and even if it the returned point of the
tessellation does not have to be one of the vertexes of the N-simplex
within which the desired point is found.

 -- : IDX = dsearch (X, Y, TRI, XI, YI)
 -- : IDX = dsearch (X, Y, TRI, XI, YI, S)
     Return the index IDX of the closest point in ‘X, Y’ to the elements
     ‘[XI(:), YI(:)]’.

     The variable S is accepted for compatibility but is ignored.

     See also: *note dsearchn: XREFdsearchn, *note tsearch: XREFtsearch.

 -- : IDX = dsearchn (X, TRI, XI)
 -- : IDX = dsearchn (X, TRI, XI, OUTVAL)
 -- : IDX = dsearchn (X, XI)
 -- : [IDX, D] = dsearchn (...)
     Return the index IDX of the closest point in X to the elements XI.

     If OUTVAL is supplied, then the values of XI that are not contained
     within one of the simplices TRI are set to OUTVAL.  Generally, TRI
     is returned from ‘delaunayn (X)’.

     See also: *note dsearch: XREFdsearch, *note tsearch: XREFtsearch.

   An example of the use of ‘dsearch’, using the above values of X, Y
and TRI is

     dsearch (X, Y, TRI, -2, -2)
     ⇒ 1

   If you wish the points that are outside the tessellation to be
flagged, then ‘dsearchn’ can be used as

     dsearchn ([X, Y], TRI, [-2, -2], NaN)
     ⇒ NaN
     dsearchn ([X, Y], TRI, [-0.5, -0.5], NaN)
     ⇒ 1

where the point outside the tessellation are then flagged with ‘NaN’.

30.2 Voronoi Diagrams
=====================

A Voronoi diagram or Voronoi tessellation of a set of points S in an
N-dimensional space, is the tessellation of the N-dimensional space such
that all points in ‘V(P)’, a partitions of the tessellation where P is a
member of S, are closer to P than any other point in S.  The Voronoi
diagram is related to the Delaunay triangulation of a set of points, in
that the vertexes of the Voronoi tessellation are the centers of the
circum-circles of the simplices of the Delaunay tessellation.

 -- : voronoi (X, Y)
 -- : voronoi (X, Y, OPTIONS)
 -- : voronoi (..., "linespec")
 -- : voronoi (HAX, ...)
 -- : H = voronoi (...)
 -- : [VX, VY] = voronoi (...)
     Plot the Voronoi diagram of points ‘(X, Y)’.

     The Voronoi facets with points at infinity are not drawn.

     The OPTIONS argument, which must be a string or cell array of
     strings, contains options passed to the underlying qhull command.
     See the documentation for the Qhull library for details
     <http://www.qhull.org/html/qh-quick.htm#options>.

     If "linespec" is given it is used to set the color and line style
     of the plot.

     If an axis graphics handle HAX is supplied then the Voronoi diagram
     is drawn on the specified axis rather than in a new figure.

     If a single output argument is requested then the Voronoi diagram
     will be plotted and a graphics handle H to the plot is returned.

     [VX, VY] = voronoi (...) returns the Voronoi vertices instead of
     plotting the diagram.

          x = rand (10, 1);
          y = rand (size (x));
          h = convhull (x, y);
          [vx, vy] = voronoi (x, y);
          plot (vx, vy, "-b", x, y, "o", x(h), y(h), "-g");
          legend ("", "points", "hull");

     XREFdelaunay, *note convhull: XREFconvhull.

 -- : [C, F] = voronoin (PTS)
 -- : [C, F] = voronoin (PTS, OPTIONS)
     Compute N-dimensional Voronoi facets.

     The input matrix PTS of size [n, dim] contains n points in a space
     of dimension dim.

     C contains the points of the Voronoi facets.  The list F contains,
     for each facet, the indices of the Voronoi points.

     An optional second argument, which must be a string or cell array
     of strings, contains options passed to the underlying qhull
     command.  See the documentation for the Qhull library for details
     <http://www.qhull.org/html/qh-quick.htm#options>.

     The default options depend on the dimension of the input:

        • 2-D and 3-D: OPTIONS = ‘{"Qbb"}’

        • 4-D and higher: OPTIONS = ‘{"Qbb", "Qx"}’

     If OPTIONS is not present or ‘[]’ then the default arguments are
     used.  Otherwise, OPTIONS replaces the default argument list.  To
     append user options to the defaults it is necessary to repeat the
     default arguments in OPTIONS.  Use a null string to pass no
     arguments.

     See also: *note voronoi: XREFvoronoi, *note convhulln:
     XREFconvhulln, *note delaunayn: XREFdelaunayn.

   An example of the use of ‘voronoi’ is

     rand ("state",9);
     x = rand (10,1);
     y = rand (10,1);
     tri = delaunay (x, y);
     [vx, vy] = voronoi (x, y, tri);
     triplot (tri, x, y, "b");
     hold on;
     plot (vx, vy, "r");

   Additional information about the size of the facets of a Voronoi
diagram, and which points of a set of points is in a polygon can be had
with the ‘polyarea’ and ‘inpolygon’ functions respectively.

 -- : polyarea (X, Y)
 -- : polyarea (X, Y, DIM)

     Determine area of a polygon by triangle method.

     The variables X and Y define the vertex pairs, and must therefore
     have the same shape.  They can be either vectors or arrays.  If
     they are arrays then the columns of X and Y are treated separately
     and an area returned for each.

     If the optional DIM argument is given, then ‘polyarea’ works along
     this dimension of the arrays X and Y.

   An example of the use of ‘polyarea’ might be

     rand ("state", 2);
     x = rand (10, 1);
     y = rand (10, 1);
     [c, f] = voronoin ([x, y]);
     af = zeros (size (f));
     for i = 1 : length (f)
       af(i) = polyarea (c (f {i, :}, 1), c (f {i, :}, 2));
     endfor

   Facets of the Voronoi diagram with a vertex at infinity have infinity
area.  A simplified version of ‘polyarea’ for rectangles is available
with ‘rectint’

 -- : AREA = rectint (A, B)
     Compute area or volume of intersection of rectangles or N-D boxes.

     Compute the area of intersection of rectangles in A and rectangles
     in B.  N-dimensional boxes are supported in which case the volume,
     or hypervolume is computed according to the number of dimensions.

     2-dimensional rectangles are defined as ‘[xpos ypos width height]’
     where xpos and ypos are the position of the bottom left corner.
     Higher dimensions are supported where the coordinates for the
     minimum value of each dimension follow the length of the box in
     that dimension, e.g., ‘[xpos ypos zpos kpos ... width height depth
     k_length ...]’.

     Each row of A and B define a rectangle, and if both define multiple
     rectangles, then the output, AREA, is a matrix where the i-th row
     corresponds to the i-th row of a and the j-th column corresponds to
     the j-th row of b.

     See also: *note polyarea: XREFpolyarea.

 -- : IN = inpolygon (X, Y, XV, YV)
 -- : [IN, ON] = inpolygon (X, Y, XV, YV)

     For a polygon defined by vertex points ‘(XV, YV)’, return true if
     the points ‘(X, Y)’ are inside (or on the boundary) of the polygon;
     Otherwise, return false.

     The input variables X and Y, must have the same dimension.

     The optional output ON returns true if the points are exactly on
     the polygon edge, and false otherwise.

     See also: *note delaunay: XREFdelaunay.

   An example of the use of ‘inpolygon’ might be

     randn ("state", 2);
     x = randn (100, 1);
     y = randn (100, 1);
     vx = cos (pi * [-1 : 0.1: 1]);
     vy = sin (pi * [-1 : 0.1 : 1]);
     in = inpolygon (x, y, vx, vy);
     plot (vx, vy, x(in), y(in), "r+", x(!in), y(!in), "bo");
     axis ([-2, 2, -2, 2]);

30.3 Convex Hull
================

The convex hull of a set of points is the minimum convex envelope
containing all of the points.  Octave has the functions ‘convhull’ and
‘convhulln’ to calculate the convex hull of 2-dimensional and
N-dimensional sets of points.

 -- : H = convhull (X, Y)
 -- : H = convhull (X, Y, OPTIONS)
     Compute the convex hull of the set of points defined by the arrays
     X and Y.  The hull H is an index vector into the set of points and
     specifies which points form the enclosing hull.

     An optional third argument, which must be a string or cell array of
     strings, contains options passed to the underlying qhull command.
     See the documentation for the Qhull library for details
     <http://www.qhull.org/html/qh-quick.htm#options>.  The default
     option is ‘{"Qt"}’.

     If OPTIONS is not present or ‘[]’ then the default arguments are
     used.  Otherwise, OPTIONS replaces the default argument list.  To
     append user options to the defaults it is necessary to repeat the
     default arguments in OPTIONS.  Use a null string to pass no
     arguments.

     See also: *note convhulln: XREFconvhulln, *note delaunay:
     XREFdelaunay, *note voronoi: XREFvoronoi.

 -- : H = convhulln (PTS)
 -- : H = convhulln (PTS, OPTIONS)
 -- : [H, V] = convhulln (...)
     Compute the convex hull of the set of points PTS.

     PTS is a matrix of size [n, dim] containing n points in a space of
     dimension dim.

     The hull H is an index vector into the set of points and specifies
     which points form the enclosing hull.

     An optional second argument, which must be a string or cell array
     of strings, contains options passed to the underlying qhull
     command.  See the documentation for the Qhull library for details
     <http://www.qhull.org/html/qh-quick.htm#options>.  The default
     options depend on the dimension of the input:

        • 2D, 3D, 4D: OPTIONS = ‘{"Qt"}’

        • 5D and higher: OPTIONS = ‘{"Qt", "Qx"}’

     If OPTIONS is not present or ‘[]’ then the default arguments are
     used.  Otherwise, OPTIONS replaces the default argument list.  To
     append user options to the defaults it is necessary to repeat the
     default arguments in OPTIONS.  Use a null string to pass no
     arguments.

     If the second output V is requested the volume of the enclosing
     convex hull is calculated.

     See also: *note convhull: XREFconvhull, *note delaunayn:
     XREFdelaunayn, *note voronoin: XREFvoronoin.

   An example of the use of ‘convhull’ is

     x = -3:0.05:3;
     y = abs (sin (x));
     k = convhull (x, y);
     plot (x(k), y(k), "r-", x, y, "b+");
     axis ([-3.05, 3.05, -0.05, 1.05]);

30.4 Interpolation on Scattered Data
====================================

An important use of the Delaunay tessellation is that it can be used to
interpolate from scattered data to an arbitrary set of points.  To do
this the N-simplex of the known set of points is calculated with
‘delaunay’ or ‘delaunayn’.  Then the simplices in to which the desired
points are found are identified.  Finally the vertices of the simplices
are used to interpolate to the desired points.  The functions that
perform this interpolation are ‘griddata’, ‘griddata3’ and ‘griddatan’.

 -- : ZI = griddata (X, Y, Z, XI, YI)
 -- : ZI = griddata (X, Y, Z, XI, YI, METHOD)
 -- : [XI, YI, ZI] = griddata (...)

     Generate a regular mesh from irregular data using interpolation.

     The function is defined by ‘Z = f (X, Y)’.  Inputs ‘X, Y, Z’ are
     vectors of the same length or ‘X, Y’ are vectors and ‘Z’ is matrix.

     The interpolation points are all ‘(XI, YI)’.  If XI, YI are vectors
     then they are made into a 2-D mesh.

     The interpolation method can be "nearest", "cubic" or "linear".  If
     method is omitted it defaults to "linear".

     See also: *note griddata3: XREFgriddata3, *note griddatan:
     XREFgriddatan, *note delaunay: XREFdelaunay.

 -- : VI = griddata3 (X, Y, Z, V, XI, YI, ZI)
 -- : VI = griddata3 (X, Y, Z, V, XI, YI, ZI, METHOD)
 -- : VI = griddata3 (X, Y, Z, V, XI, YI, ZI, METHOD, OPTIONS)

     Generate a regular mesh from irregular data using interpolation.

     The function is defined by ‘V = f (X, Y, Z)’.  The interpolation
     points are specified by XI, YI, ZI.

     The interpolation method can be "nearest" or "linear".  If method
     is omitted it defaults to "linear".

     The optional argument OPTIONS is passed directly to Qhull when
     computing the Delaunay triangulation used for interpolation.  See
     ‘delaunayn’ for information on the defaults and how to pass
     different values.

     See also: *note griddata: XREFgriddata, *note griddatan:
     XREFgriddatan, *note delaunayn: XREFdelaunayn.

 -- : YI = griddatan (X, Y, XI)
 -- : YI = griddatan (X, Y, XI, METHOD)
 -- : YI = griddatan (X, Y, XI, METHOD, OPTIONS)

     Generate a regular mesh from irregular data using interpolation.

     The function is defined by ‘Y = f (X)’.  The interpolation points
     are all XI.

     The interpolation method can be "nearest" or "linear".  If method
     is omitted it defaults to "linear".

     The optional argument OPTIONS is passed directly to Qhull when
     computing the Delaunay triangulation used for interpolation.  See
     ‘delaunayn’ for information on the defaults and how to pass
     different values.

     See also: *note griddata: XREFgriddata, *note griddata3:
     XREFgriddata3, *note delaunayn: XREFdelaunayn.

   An example of the use of the ‘griddata’ function is

     rand ("state", 1);
     x = 2*rand (1000,1) - 1;
     y = 2*rand (size (x)) - 1;
     z = sin (2*(x.^2+y.^2));
     [xx,yy] = meshgrid (linspace (-1,1,32));
     zz = griddata (x, y, z, xx, yy);
     mesh (xx, yy, zz);

that interpolates from a random scattering of points, to a uniform grid.

31 Signal Processing
********************

This chapter describes the signal processing and fast Fourier transform
functions available in Octave.  Fast Fourier transforms are computed
with the FFTW or FFTPACK libraries depending on how Octave is built.

 -- : fft (X)
 -- : fft (X, N)
 -- : fft (X, N, DIM)
     Compute the discrete Fourier transform of A using a Fast Fourier
     Transform (FFT) algorithm.

     The FFT is calculated along the first non-singleton dimension of
     the array.  Thus if X is a matrix, ‘fft (X)’ computes the FFT for
     each column of X.

     If called with two arguments, N is expected to be an integer
     specifying the number of elements of X to use, or an empty matrix
     to specify that its value should be ignored.  If N is larger than
     the dimension along which the FFT is calculated, then X is resized
     and padded with zeros.  Otherwise, if N is smaller than the
     dimension along which the FFT is calculated, then X is truncated.

     If called with three arguments, DIM is an integer specifying the
     dimension of the matrix along which the FFT is performed

     See also: *note ifft: XREFifft, *note fft2: XREFfft2, *note fftn:
     XREFfftn, *note fftw: XREFfftw.

 -- : ifft (X)
 -- : ifft (X, N)
 -- : ifft (X, N, DIM)
     Compute the inverse discrete Fourier transform of A using a Fast
     Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm.

     The inverse FFT is calculated along the first non-singleton
     dimension of the array.  Thus if X is a matrix, ‘fft (X)’ computes
     the inverse FFT for each column of X.

     If called with two arguments, N is expected to be an integer
     specifying the number of elements of X to use, or an empty matrix
     to specify that its value should be ignored.  If N is larger than
     the dimension along which the inverse FFT is calculated, then X is
     resized and padded with zeros.  Otherwise, if N is smaller than the
     dimension along which the inverse FFT is calculated, then X is
     truncated.

     If called with three arguments, DIM is an integer specifying the
     dimension of the matrix along which the inverse FFT is performed

     See also: *note fft: XREFfft, *note ifft2: XREFifft2, *note ifftn:
     XREFifftn, *note fftw: XREFfftw.

 -- : fft2 (A)
 -- : fft2 (A, M, N)
     Compute the two-dimensional discrete Fourier transform of A using a
     Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm.

     The optional arguments M and N may be used specify the number of
     rows and columns of A to use.  If either of these is larger than
     the size of A, A is resized and padded with zeros.

     If A is a multi-dimensional matrix, each two-dimensional sub-matrix
     of A is treated separately.

     See also: *note ifft2: XREFifft2, *note fft: XREFfft, *note fftn:
     XREFfftn, *note fftw: XREFfftw.

 -- : ifft2 (A)
 -- : ifft2 (A, M, N)
     Compute the inverse two-dimensional discrete Fourier transform of A
     using a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm.

     The optional arguments M and N may be used specify the number of
     rows and columns of A to use.  If either of these is larger than
     the size of A, A is resized and padded with zeros.

     If A is a multi-dimensional matrix, each two-dimensional sub-matrix
     of A is treated separately

     See also: *note fft2: XREFfft2, *note ifft: XREFifft, *note ifftn:
     XREFifftn, *note fftw: XREFfftw.

 -- : fftn (A)
 -- : fftn (A, SIZE)
     Compute the N-dimensional discrete Fourier transform of A using a
     Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm.

     The optional vector argument SIZE may be used specify the
     dimensions of the array to be used.  If an element of SIZE is
     smaller than the corresponding dimension of A, then the dimension
     of A is truncated prior to performing the FFT.  Otherwise, if an
     element of SIZE is larger than the corresponding dimension then A
     is resized and padded with zeros.

     See also: *note ifftn: XREFifftn, *note fft: XREFfft, *note fft2:
     XREFfft2, *note fftw: XREFfftw.

 -- : ifftn (A)
 -- : ifftn (A, SIZE)
     Compute the inverse N-dimensional discrete Fourier transform of A
     using a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm.

     The optional vector argument SIZE may be used specify the
     dimensions of the array to be used.  If an element of SIZE is
     smaller than the corresponding dimension of A, then the dimension
     of A is truncated prior to performing the inverse FFT.  Otherwise,
     if an element of SIZE is larger than the corresponding dimension
     then A is resized and padded with zeros.

     XREFifft2, *note fftw: XREFfftw.

   Octave uses the FFTW libraries to perform FFT computations.  When
Octave starts up and initializes the FFTW libraries, they read a system
wide file (on a Unix system, it is typically ‘/etc/fftw/wisdom’) that
contains information useful to speed up FFT computations.  This
information is called the _wisdom_.  The system-wide file allows wisdom
to be shared between all applications using the FFTW libraries.

   Use the ‘fftw’ function to generate and save wisdom.  Using the
utilities provided together with the FFTW libraries (‘fftw-wisdom’ on
Unix systems), you can even add wisdom generated by Octave to the
system-wide wisdom file.

 -- : METHOD = fftw ("planner")
 -- : fftw ("planner", METHOD)
 -- : WISDOM = fftw ("dwisdom")
 -- : fftw ("dwisdom", WISDOM)
 -- : fftw ("threads", NTHREADS)
 -- : NTHREADS = fftw ("threads")

     Manage FFTW wisdom data.

     Wisdom data can be used to significantly accelerate the calculation
     of the FFTs, but implies an initial cost in its calculation.  When
     the FFTW libraries are initialized, they read a system wide wisdom
     file (typically in ‘/etc/fftw/wisdom’), allowing wisdom to be
     shared between applications other than Octave.  Alternatively, the
     ‘fftw’ function can be used to import wisdom.  For example,

          WISDOM = fftw ("dwisdom")

     will save the existing wisdom used by Octave to the string WISDOM.
     This string can then be saved to a file and restored using the
     ‘save’ and ‘load’ commands respectively.  This existing wisdom can
     be re-imported as follows

          fftw ("dwisdom", WISDOM)

     If WISDOM is an empty string, then the wisdom used is cleared.

     During the calculation of Fourier transforms further wisdom is
     generated.  The fashion in which this wisdom is generated is also
     controlled by the ‘fftw’ function.  There are five different
     manners in which the wisdom can be treated:

     "estimate"
          Specifies that no run-time measurement of the optimal means of
          calculating a particular is performed, and a simple heuristic
          is used to pick a (probably sub-optimal) plan.  The advantage
          of this method is that there is little or no overhead in the
          generation of the plan, which is appropriate for a Fourier
          transform that will be calculated once.

     "measure"
          In this case a range of algorithms to perform the transform is
          considered and the best is selected based on their execution
          time.

     "patient"
          Similar to "measure", but a wider range of algorithms is
          considered.

     "exhaustive"
          Like "measure", but all possible algorithms that may be used
          to treat the transform are considered.

     "hybrid"
          As run-time measurement of the algorithm can be expensive,
          this is a compromise where "measure" is used for transforms up
          to the size of 8192 and beyond that the "estimate" method is
          used.

     The default method is "estimate".  The current method can be
     queried with

          METHOD = fftw ("planner")

     or set by using

          fftw ("planner", METHOD)

     Note that calculated wisdom will be lost when restarting Octave.
     However, the wisdom data can be reloaded if it is saved to a file
     as described above.  Saved wisdom files should not be used on
     different platforms since they will not be efficient and the point
     of calculating the wisdom is lost.

     The number of threads used for computing the plans and executing
     the transforms can be set with

          fftw ("threads", NTHREADS)

     Note that octave must be compiled with multi-threaded FFTW support
     for this feature.  The number of processors available to the
     current process is used per default.

     See also: *note fft: XREFfft, *note ifft: XREFifft, *note fft2:
     XREFfft2, *note ifft2: XREFifft2, *note fftn: XREFfftn, *note
     ifftn: XREFifftn.

 -- : fftconv (X, Y)
 -- : fftconv (X, Y, N)
     Convolve two vectors using the FFT for computation.

     ‘c = fftconv (X, Y)’ returns a vector of length equal to ‘length
     (X) + length (Y) - 1’.  If X and Y are the coefficient vectors of
     two polynomials, the returned value is the coefficient vector of
     the product polynomial.

     The computation uses the FFT by calling the function ‘fftfilt’.  If
     the optional argument N is specified, an N-point FFT is used.

     See also: *note deconv: XREFdeconv, *note conv: XREFconv, *note
     conv2: XREFconv2.

 -- : fftfilt (B, X)
 -- : fftfilt (B, X, N)
     Filter X with the FIR filter B using the FFT.

     If X is a matrix, filter each column of the matrix.

     Given the optional third argument, N, ‘fftfilt’ uses the
     overlap-add method to filter X with B using an N-point FFT.  The
     FFT size must be an even power of 2 and must be greater than or
     equal to the length of B.  If the specified N does not meet these
     criteria, it is automatically adjusted to the nearest value that
     does.

     See also: *note filter: XREFfilter, *note filter2: XREFfilter2.

 -- : Y = filter (B, A, X)
 -- : [Y, SF] = filter (B, A, X, SI)
 -- : [Y, SF] = filter (B, A, X, [], DIM)
 -- : [Y, SF] = filter (B, A, X, SI, DIM)
     Apply a 1-D digital filter to the data X.

     ‘filter’ returns the solution to the following linear,
     time-invariant difference equation:

           N                   M
          SUM a(k+1) y(n-k) = SUM b(k+1) x(n-k)    for 1<=n<=length(x)
          k=0                 k=0

     where N=length(a)-1 and M=length(b)-1.  The result is calculated
     over the first non-singleton dimension of X or over DIM if
     supplied.

     An equivalent form of the equation is:

                    N                   M
          y(n) = - SUM c(k+1) y(n-k) + SUM d(k+1) x(n-k)  for 1<=n<=length(x)
                   k=1                 k=0

     where c = a/a(1) and d = b/a(1).

     If the fourth argument SI is provided, it is taken as the initial
     state of the system and the final state is returned as SF.  The
     state vector is a column vector whose length is equal to the length
     of the longest coefficient vector minus one.  If SI is not
     supplied, the initial state vector is set to all zeros.

     In terms of the Z Transform, Y is the result of passing the
     discrete-time signal X through a system characterized by the
     following rational system function:

                    M
                   SUM d(k+1) z^(-k)

 -- : Y = filter2 (B, X)
 -- : Y = filter2 (B, X, SHAPE)
     Apply the 2-D FIR filter B to X.

     If the argument SHAPE is specified, return an array of the desired
     shape.  Possible values are:

     "full"
          pad X with zeros on all sides before filtering.

     "same"
          unpadded X (default)

     "valid"
          trim X after filtering so edge effects are no included.

     Note this is just a variation on convolution, with the parameters
     reversed and B rotated 180 degrees.

 -- : [H, W] = freqz (B, A, N, "whole")
 -- : [H, W] = freqz (B)
 -- : [H, W] = freqz (B, A)
 -- : [H, W] = freqz (B, A, N)
 -- : H = freqz (B, A, W)
 -- : [H, W] = freqz (..., FS)
 -- : freqz (...)

     Return the complex frequency response H of the rational IIR filter
     whose numerator and denominator coefficients are B and A,
     respectively.

     The response is evaluated at N angular frequencies between 0 and
     2*pi.

     The output value W is a vector of the frequencies.

     If A is omitted, the denominator is assumed to be 1 (this
     corresponds to a simple FIR filter).

     If N is omitted, a value of 512 is assumed.  For fastest
     computation, N should factor into a small number of small primes.

     If the fourth argument, "whole", is omitted the response is
     evaluated at frequencies between 0 and pi.

     ‘freqz (B, A, W)’

     Evaluate the response at the specific frequencies in the vector W.
     The values for W are measured in radians.

     ‘[...] = freqz (..., FS)’

     Return frequencies in Hz instead of radians assuming a sampling
     rate FS.  If you are evaluating the response at specific
     frequencies W, those frequencies should be requested in Hz rather
     than radians.

     ‘freqz (...)’

     Plot the magnitude and phase response of H rather than returning
     them.

     See also: *note freqz_plot: XREFfreqz_plot.

 -- : freqz_plot (W, H)
 -- : freqz_plot (W, H, FREQ_NORM)
     Plot the magnitude and phase response of H.

     If the optional FREQ_NORM argument is true, the frequency vector W
     is in units of normalized radians.  If FREQ_NORM is false, or not
     given, then W is measured in Hertz.

     See also: *note freqz: XREFfreqz.

 -- : sinc (X)
     Compute the sinc function.

     Return sin (pi*x) / (pi*x).

 -- : B = unwrap (X)
 -- : B = unwrap (X, TOL)
 -- : B = unwrap (X, TOL, DIM)

     Unwrap radian phases by adding or subtracting multiples of 2*pi as
     appropriate to remove jumps greater than TOL.

     TOL defaults to pi.

     Unwrap will work along the dimension DIM.  If DIM is unspecified it
     defaults to the first non-singleton dimension.

 -- : [A, B] = arch_fit (Y, X, P, ITER, GAMMA, A0, B0)
     Fit an ARCH regression model to the time series Y using the scoring
     algorithm in Engle’s original ARCH paper.

     The model is

          y(t) = b(1) * x(t,1) + ... + b(k) * x(t,k) + e(t),
          h(t) = a(1) + a(2) * e(t-1)^2 + ... + a(p+1) * e(t-p)^2

     in which e(t) is N(0, h(t)), given a time-series vector Y up to
     time t-1 and a matrix of (ordinary) regressors X up to t.  The
     order of the regression of the residual variance is specified by P.

     If invoked as ‘arch_fit (Y, K, P)’ with a positive integer K, fit
     an ARCH(K, P) process, i.e., do the above with the t-th row of X
     given by

          [1, y(t-1), ..., y(t-k)]

     Optionally, one can specify the number of iterations ITER, the
     updating factor GAMMA, and initial values a0 and b0 for the scoring
     algorithm.

 -- : arch_rnd (A, B, T)
     Simulate an ARCH sequence of length T with AR coefficients B and CH
     coefficients A.

     The result y(t) follows the model

          y(t) = b(1) + b(2) * y(t-1) + ... + b(lb) * y(t-lb+1) + e(t),

     where e(t), given Y up to time t-1, is N(0, h(t)), with

          h(t) = a(1) + a(2) * e(t-1)^2 + ... + a(la) * e(t-la+1)^2

 -- : [PVAL, LM] = arch_test (Y, X, P)
     For a linear regression model

          y = x * b + e

     perform a Lagrange Multiplier (LM) test of the null hypothesis of
     no conditional heteroscedascity against the alternative of CH(P).

     I.e., the model is

          y(t) = b(1) * x(t,1) + ... + b(k) * x(t,k) + e(t),

     given Y up to t-1 and X up to t, e(t) is N(0, h(t)) with

          h(t) = v + a(1) * e(t-1)^2 + ... + a(p) * e(t-p)^2,

     and the null is a(1) == ... == a(p) == 0.

     If the second argument is a scalar integer, k, perform the same
     test in a linear autoregression model of order k, i.e., with

          [1, y(t-1), ..., y(t-K)]

     as the t-th row of X.

     Under the null, LM approximately has a chisquare distribution with
     P degrees of freedom and PVAL is the p-value (1 minus the CDF of
     this distribution at LM) of the test.

     If no output argument is given, the p-value is displayed.

 -- : arma_rnd (A, B, V, T, N)
     Return a simulation of the ARMA model.

     The ARMA model is defined by

          x(n) = a(1) * x(n-1) + ... + a(k) * x(n-k)
               + e(n) + b(1) * e(n-1) + ... + b(l) * e(n-l)

     in which K is the length of vector A, L is the length of vector B
     and E is Gaussian white noise with variance V.  The function
     returns a vector of length T.

     The optional parameter N gives the number of dummy X(I) used for
     initialization, i.e., a sequence of length T+N is generated and
     X(N+1:T+N) is returned.  If N is omitted, N = 100 is used.

 -- : autoreg_matrix (Y, K)
     Given a time series (vector) Y, return a matrix with ones in the
     first column and the first K lagged values of Y in the other
     columns.

     In other words, for T > K, ‘[1, Y(T-1), ..., Y(T-K)]’ is the t-th
     row of the result.

     The resulting matrix may be used as a regressor matrix in
     autoregressions.

 -- : bartlett (M)
     Return the filter coefficients of a Bartlett (triangular) window of
     length M.

     For a definition of the Bartlett window see, e.g., A.V. Oppenheim &
     R. W. Schafer, ‘Discrete-Time Signal Processing’.

 -- : blackman (M)
 -- : blackman (M, "periodic")
 -- : blackman (M, "symmetric")
     Return the filter coefficients of a Blackman window of length M.

     If the optional argument "periodic" is given, the periodic form of
     the window is returned.  This is equivalent to the window of length
     M+1 with the last coefficient removed.  The optional argument
     "symmetric" is equivalent to not specifying a second argument.

     For a definition of the Blackman window, see, e.g., A.V. Oppenheim
     & R. W. Schafer, ‘Discrete-Time Signal Processing’.

 -- : detrend (X, P)
     If X is a vector, ‘detrend (X, P)’ removes the best fit of a
     polynomial of order P from the data X.

     If X is a matrix, ‘detrend (X, P)’ does the same for each column in
     X.

     The second argument P is optional.  If it is not specified, a value
     of 1 is assumed.  This corresponds to removing a linear trend.

     The order of the polynomial can also be given as a string, in which
     case P must be either "constant" (corresponds to ‘P=0’) or "linear"
     (corresponds to ‘P=1’).

     See also: *note polyfit: XREFpolyfit.

 -- : [D, DD] = diffpara (X, A, B)
     Return the estimator D for the differencing parameter of an
     integrated time series.

     The frequencies from [2*pi*a/t, 2*pi*b/T] are used for the
     estimation.  If B is omitted, the interval [2*pi/T, 2*pi*a/T] is
     used.  If both B and A are omitted then a = 0.5 * sqrt (T) and b =
     1.5 * sqrt (T) is used, where T is the sample size.  If X is a
     matrix, the differencing parameter of each column is estimated.

     The estimators for all frequencies in the intervals described above
     is returned in DD.

     The value of D is simply the mean of DD.

     Methods’.  Springer 1987.

 -- : durbinlevinson (C, OLDPHI, OLDV)
     Perform one step of the Durbin-Levinson algorithm.

     The vector C specifies the autocovariances ‘[gamma_0, ...,
     gamma_t]’ from lag 0 to T, OLDPHI specifies the coefficients based
     on C(T-1) and OLDV specifies the corresponding error.

     If OLDPHI and OLDV are omitted, all steps from 1 to T of the
     algorithm are performed.

 -- : fftshift (X)
 -- : fftshift (X, DIM)
     Perform a shift of the vector X, for use with the ‘fft’ and ‘ifft’
     functions, in order the move the frequency 0 to the center of the
     vector or matrix.

     If X is a vector of N elements corresponding to N time samples
     spaced by dt, then ‘fftshift (fft (X))’ corresponds to frequencies

          f = [ -(ceil((N-1)/2):-1:1)*df 0 (1:floor((N-1)/2))*df ]

     where df = 1 / dt.

     If X is a matrix, the same holds for rows and columns.  If X is an
     array, then the same holds along each dimension.

     The optional DIM argument can be used to limit the dimension along
     which the permutation occurs.

     See also: *note ifftshift: XREFifftshift.

 -- : ifftshift (X)
 -- : ifftshift (X, DIM)
     Undo the action of the ‘fftshift’ function.

     For even length X, ‘fftshift’ is its own inverse, but odd lengths
     differ slightly.

     See also: *note fftshift: XREFfftshift.

 -- : fractdiff (X, D)
     Compute the fractional differences (1-L)^d x where L denotes the
     lag-operator and d is greater than -1.

 -- : hamming (M)
 -- : hamming (M, "periodic")
 -- : hamming (M, "symmetric")
     Return the filter coefficients of a Hamming window of length M.

     If the optional argument "periodic" is given, the periodic form of
     the window is returned.  This is equivalent to the window of length
     M+1 with the last coefficient removed.  The optional argument
     "symmetric" is equivalent to not specifying a second argument.

     For a definition of the Hamming window see, e.g., A.V. Oppenheim &
     R. W. Schafer, ‘Discrete-Time Signal Processing’.

 -- : hanning (M)
 -- : hanning (M, "periodic")
 -- : hanning (M, "symmetric")
     Return the filter coefficients of a Hanning window of length M.

     If the optional argument "periodic" is given, the periodic form of
     the window is returned.  This is equivalent to the window of length
     M+1 with the last coefficient removed.  The optional argument
     "symmetric" is equivalent to not specifying a second argument.

     For a definition of the Hanning window see, e.g., A.V. Oppenheim &
     R. W. Schafer, ‘Discrete-Time Signal Processing’.

 -- : hurst (X)
     Estimate the Hurst parameter of sample X via the rescaled range
     statistic.

     If X is a matrix, the parameter is estimated for every column.

 -- : PP = pchip (X, Y)
 -- : YI = pchip (X, Y, XI)
     Return the Piecewise Cubic Hermite Interpolating Polynomial (pchip)
     of points X and Y.

     If called with two arguments, return the piecewise polynomial PP
     that may be used with ‘ppval’ to evaluate the polynomial at
     specific points.

     When called with a third input argument, ‘pchip’ evaluates the
     pchip polynomial at the points XI.  The third calling form is
     equivalent to ‘ppval (pchip (X, Y), XI)’.

     The variable X must be a strictly monotonic vector (either
     increasing or decreasing) of length N.

     Y can be either a vector or array.  If Y is a vector then it must
     be the same length N as X.  If Y is an array then the size of Y
     must have the form ‘[S1, S2, ..., SK, N]’ The array is reshaped
     internally to a matrix where the leading dimension is given by ‘S1
     * S2 * ... * SK’ and each row of this matrix is then treated
     separately.  Note that this is exactly opposite to ‘interp1’ but is
     done for MATLAB compatibility.

 -- : [PXX, F] = periodogram (X, WIN, NFFT, FS)
 -- : [PXX, F] = periodogram (..., "RANGE")
 -- : periodogram (...)
     Return the periodogram (Power Spectral Density) of X.

     The possible inputs are:

     X

          data vector.  If X is real-valued a one-sided spectrum is
          estimated.  If X is complex-valued, or "RANGE" specifies
          "twosided", the full spectrum is estimated.

     WIN
          window weight data.  If window is empty or unspecified a
          default rectangular window is used.  Otherwise, the window is
          applied to the signal (‘X .* WIN’) before computing the
          periodogram.  The window data must be a vector of the same
          length as X.

     NFFT
          number of frequency bins.  The default is 256 or the next
          higher power of 2 greater than the length of X (‘max (256,
          2.^nextpow2 (length (x)))’).  If NFFT is greater than the
          length of the input then X will be zero-padded to the length
          of NFFT.

     FS
          sampling rate.  The default is 1.

     RANGE
          range of spectrum.  "onesided" computes spectrum from
          [0..nfft/2+1].  "twosided" computes spectrum from [0..nfft-1].

     The optional second output W are the normalized angular
     frequencies.  For a one-sided calculation W is in the range [0, pi]
     if NFFT is even and [0, pi) if NFFT is odd.  Similarly, for a
     two-sided calculation W is in the range [0, 2*pi] or [0, 2*pi)
     depending on NFFT.

     If a sampling frequency is specified, FS, then the output
     frequencies F will be in the range [0, FS/2] or [0, FS/2) for
     one-sided calculations.  For two-sided calculations the range will
     be [0, FS).

     When called with no outputs the periodogram is immediately plotted
     in the current figure window.

     See also: *note fft: XREFfft.

 -- : sinetone (FREQ, RATE, SEC, AMPL)
     Return a sinetone of frequency FREQ with a length of SEC seconds at
     sampling rate RATE and with amplitude AMPL.

     The arguments FREQ and AMPL may be vectors of common size.

     The defaults are RATE = 8000, SEC = 1, and AMPL = 64.

     See also: *note sinewave: XREFsinewave.

 -- : sinewave (M, N, D)
     Return an M-element vector with I-th element given by ‘sin (2 * pi
     * (I+D-1) / N)’.

     The default value for D is 0 and the default value for N is M.

     See also: *note sinetone: XREFsinetone.

 -- : spectral_adf (C)
 -- : spectral_adf (C, WIN)
 -- : spectral_adf (C, WIN, B)
     Return the spectral density estimator given a vector of
     autocovariances C, window name WIN, and bandwidth, B.

     The window name, e.g., "triangle" or "rectangle" is used to search
     for a function called ‘WIN_lw’.

     If WIN is omitted, the triangle window is used.

     If B is omitted, ‘1 / sqrt (length (X))’ is used.

     See also: *note spectral_xdf: XREFspectral_xdf.

 -- : spectral_xdf (X)
 -- : spectral_xdf (X, WIN)
 -- : spectral_xdf (X, WIN, B)
     Return the spectral density estimator given a data vector X, window
     name WIN, and bandwidth, B.

     The window name, e.g., "triangle" or "rectangle" is used to search
     for a function called ‘WIN_sw’.

     If WIN is omitted, the triangle window is used.

     If B is omitted, ‘1 / sqrt (length (X))’ is used.

     See also: *note spectral_adf: XREFspectral_adf.

 -- : spencer (X)
     Return Spencer’s 15 point moving average of each column of X.

 -- : Y = stft (X)
 -- : Y = stft (X, WIN_SIZE)
 -- : Y = stft (X, WIN_SIZE, INC)
 -- : Y = stft (X, WIN_SIZE, INC, NUM_COEF)
 -- : Y = stft (X, WIN_SIZE, INC, NUM_COEF, WIN_TYPE)
 -- : [Y, C] = stft (...)
     Compute the short-time Fourier transform of the vector X with
     NUM_COEF coefficients by applying a window of WIN_SIZE data points
     and an increment of INC points.

     Before computing the Fourier transform, one of the following
     windows is applied:

     "hanning"
          win_type = 1

     "hamming"
          win_type = 2

     "rectangle"
          win_type = 3

     The window names can be passed as strings or by the WIN_TYPE
     number.

     The following defaults are used for unspecified arguments: WIN_SIZE
     = 80, INC = 24, NUM_COEF = 64, and WIN_TYPE = 1.

     ‘Y = stft (X, ...)’ returns the absolute values of the Fourier
     coefficients according to the NUM_COEF positive frequencies.

     ‘[Y, C] = stft (x, ...)’ returns the entire STFT-matrix Y and a
     3-element vector C containing the window size, increment, and
     window type, which is needed by the ‘synthesis’ function.

     See also: *note synthesis: XREFsynthesis.

 -- : X = synthesis (Y, C)
     Compute a signal from its short-time Fourier transform Y and a
     3-element vector C specifying window size, increment, and window
     type.

     The values Y and C can be derived by

          [Y, C] = stft (X , ...)

32 Image Processing
*******************

Since an image is basically a matrix, Octave is a very powerful
environment for processing and analyzing images.  To illustrate how easy
it is to do image processing in Octave, the following example will load
an image, smooth it by a 5-by-5 averaging filter, and compute the
gradient of the smoothed image.

     I = imread ("myimage.jpg");
     S = conv2 (I, ones (5, 5) / 25, "same");
     [Dx, Dy] = gradient (S);

In this example ‘S’ contains the smoothed image, and ‘Dx’ and ‘Dy’
contains the partial spatial derivatives of the image.

32.1 Loading and Saving Images
==============================

The first step in most image processing tasks is to load an image into
Octave which is done with the ‘imread’ function.  The ‘imwrite’ function
is the corresponding function for writing images to the disk.

   In summary, most image processing code will follow the structure of
this code

     I = imread ("my_input_image.img");
     J = process_my_image (I);
     imwrite (J, "my_output_image.img");

 -- : [IMG, MAP, ALPHA] = imread (FILENAME)
 -- : [...] = imread (URL)
 -- : [...] = imread (..., EXT)
 -- : [...] = imread (..., IDX)
 -- : [...] = imread (..., PARAM1, VALUE1, ...)
     Read images from various file formats.

     Read an image as a matrix from the file FILENAME or from the online
     resource URL.  If neither is given, but EXT was specified, look for
     a file with the extension EXT.

     The size and class of the output depends on the format of the
     image.  A color image is returned as an MxNx3 matrix.  Grayscale
     and black-and-white images are of size MxN.  Multipage images will
     have an additional 4th dimension.

     The bit depth of the image determines the class of the output:
     "uint8", "uint16", or "single" for grayscale and color, and
     "logical" for black-and-white.  Note that indexed images always
     return the indexes for a colormap, independent of whether MAP is a
     requested output.  To obtain the actual RGB image, use ‘ind2rgb’.
     When more than one indexed image is being read, MAP is obtained
     from the first.  In some rare cases this may be incorrect and
     ‘imfinfo’ can be used to obtain the colormap of each image.

     See the Octave manual for more information in representing images.

     Some file formats, such as TIFF and GIF, are able to store multiple
     images in a single file.  IDX can be a scalar or vector specifying
     the index of the images to read.  By default, Octave will read only
     the first page.

     Depending on the file format, it is possible to configure the
     reading of images with PARAMETER, VALUE pairs.  The following
     options are supported:

     "Frames" or "Index"
          This is an alternative method to specify IDX.  When specifying
          it in this way, its value can also be the string "all".

     "Info"
          This option exists for MATLAB compatibility, but has no
          effect.  For maximum performance when reading multiple images
          from a single file, use the "Index" option.

     "PixelRegion"
          Controls the image region that is read.  The value must be a
          cell array with two arrays of 3 elements ‘{[ROWS], [COLS]}’.
          The elements in the array are the start, increment, and end
          pixel to be read.  If the increment value is omitted it
          defaults to 1.  For example, the following are all equivalent:

               imread (filename, "PixelRegion", {[200 600], [300 700]});
               imread (filename, "PixelRegion", {[200 1 600], [300 1 700]});
               imread (filename)(200:600, 300:700);

     Write images in various file formats.

     The image IMG can be a binary, grayscale, RGB, or multi-dimensional
     image.  The size and class of IMG should be the same as what should
     be expected when reading it with ‘imread’: the 3rd and 4th
     dimensions reserved for color space, and multiple pages
     respectively.  If it’s an indexed image, the colormap MAP must also
     be specified.

     If EXT is not supplied, the file extension of FILENAME is used to
     determine the format.  The actual supported formats are dependent
     on options made during the build of Octave.  Use ‘imformats’ to
     check the support of the different image formats.

     Depending on the file format, it is possible to configure the
     writing of images with PARAM, VAL pairs.  The following options are
     supported:

     ‘Alpha’
          Alpha (transparency) channel for the image.  This must be a
          matrix with same class, and number of rows and columns of IMG.
          In case of a multipage image, the size of the 4th dimension
          must also match and the third dimension must be a singleton.
          By default, image will be completely opaque.

     ‘Compression’
          Compression to use one the image.  Can be one of the
          following: "none" (default), "bzip", "fax3", "fax4", "jpeg",
          "lzw", "rle", or "deflate".  Note that not all compression
          types are available for all image formats in which it defaults
          to your Magick library.

     ‘DelayTime’
          For formats that accept animations (such as GIF), controls for
          how long a frame is displayed until it moves to the next one.
          The value must be scalar (which will applied to all frames in
          IMG), or a vector of length equal to the number of frames in
          IM.  The value is in seconds, must be between 0 and 655.35,
          and defaults to 0.5.

     ‘DisposalMethod’
          For formats that accept animations (such as GIF), controls
          what happens to a frame before drawing the next one.  Its
          value can be one of the following strings: "doNotSpecify"
          (default); "leaveInPlace"; "restoreBG"; and "restorePrevious",
          or a cell array of those string with length equal to the
          number of frames in IMG.

     ‘LoopCount’
          For formats that accept animations (such as GIF), controls how
          many times the sequence is repeated.  A value of Inf means an
          infinite loop (default), a value of 0 or 1 that the sequence
          is played only once (loops zero times), while a value of 2 or
          above loops that number of times (looping twice means it plays
          the complete sequence 3 times).  This option is ignored when
          there is only a single image at the end of writing the file.

     ‘Quality’
          Set the quality of the compression.  The value should be an
          integer between 0 and 100, with larger values indicating
          higher visual quality and lower compression.  Defaults to 75.

     ‘WriteMode’
          Some file formats, such as TIFF and GIF, are able to store
          multiple images in a single file.  This option specifies if
          IMG should be appended to the file (if it exists) or if a new
          file should be created for it (possibly overwriting an
          existing file).  The value should be the string "Overwrite"
          (default), or "Append".

          Despite this option, the most efficient method of writing a
          multipage image is to pass a 4 dimensional IMG to ‘imwrite’,
          the same matrix that could be expected when using ‘imread’
          with the option "Index" set to "all".

     *note imformats: XREFimformats.

 -- : VAL = IMAGE_PATH ()
 -- : OLD_VAL = IMAGE_PATH (NEW_VAL)
 -- : IMAGE_PATH (NEW_VAL, "local")
     Query or set the internal variable that specifies a colon separated
     list of directories in which to search for image files.

     When called from inside a function with the "local" option, the
     variable is changed locally for the function and any subroutines it
     calls.  The original variable value is restored when exiting the
     function.

     XREFOCTAVE_HOME.

   It is possible to get information about an image file on disk,
without actually reading it into Octave.  This is done using the
‘imfinfo’ function which provides read access to many of the parameters
stored in the header of the image file.

 -- : INFO = imfinfo (FILENAME)
 -- : INFO = imfinfo (URL)
 -- : INFO = imfinfo (..., EXT)
     Read image information from a file.

     ‘imfinfo’ returns a structure containing information about the
     image stored in the file FILENAME.  If there is no file FILENAME,
     and EXT was specified, it will look for a file named FILENAME and
     extension EXT, i.e., a file named FILENAME.EXT.

     The output structure INFO contains the following fields:

     ‘Filename’
          The full name of the image file.

     ‘FileModDate’
          Date of last modification to the file.

     ‘FileSize’

     ‘YResolution’
          Y resolution of the image.

     ‘ResolutionUnit’
          Units of image resolution.  Value is "Inch", "Centimeter", or
          "undefined".

     ‘DelayTime’
          Time in 1/100ths of a second (0 to 65535) which must expire
          before displaying the next image in an animated sequence.

     ‘LoopCount’
          Number of iterations to loop an animation.

     ‘ByteOrder’
          Endian option for formats that support it.  Value is
          "little-endian", "big-endian", or "undefined".

     ‘Gamma’
          Gamma level of the image.  The same color image displayed on
          two different workstations may look different due to
          differences in the display monitor.

     ‘Quality’
          JPEG/MIFF/PNG compression level.  Value is an integer in the
          range [0 100].

     ‘DisposalMethod’
          Only valid for GIF images, control how successive frames are
          rendered (how the preceding frame is disposed of) when
          creating a GIF animation.  Values can be "doNotSpecify",
          "leaveInPlace", "restoreBG", or "restorePrevious".  For
          non-GIF files, value is an empty string.

     ‘Chromaticities’
          Value is a 1x8 Matrix with the x,y chromaticity values for
          white, red, green, and blue points, in that order.

     *note imshow: XREFimshow, *note imformats: XREFimformats.

   By default, Octave’s image IO functions (‘imread’, ‘imwrite’, and
‘imfinfo’) use the ‘GraphicsMagick’ library for their operations.  This
means a vast number of image formats is supported but considering the
large amount of image formats in science and its commonly closed nature,
it is impossible to have a library capable of reading them all.  Because
of this, the function ‘imformats’ keeps a configurable list of available
formats, their extensions, and what functions should the image IO
functions use.  This allows one to expand Octave’s image IO capabilities
by creating functions aimed at acting on specific file formats.

   While it would be possible to call the extra functions directly,
properly configuring Octave with ‘imformats’ allows one to keep a
consistent code that is abstracted from file formats.

   It is important to note that a file format is not actually defined by
its file extension and that ‘GraphicsMagick’ is capable to read and
write more file formats than the ones listed by ‘imformats’.  What this
means is that even with an incorrect or missing extension the image may
still be read correctly, and that even unlisted formats are not
necessarily unsupported.

 -- : imformats ()
 -- : FORMATS = imformats (EXT)
 -- : FORMATS = imformats (FORMAT)
 -- : FORMATS = imformats ("add", FORMAT)
 -- : FORMATS = imformats ("remove", EXT)
 -- : FORMATS = imformats ("update", EXT, FORMAT)
 -- : FORMATS = imformats ("factory")
     Manage supported image formats.

     FORMATS is a structure with information about each supported file
     format, or from a specific format EXT, the value displayed on the
     field ‘ext’.  It contains the following fields:

     ext
          The name of the file format.  This may match the file
          extension but Octave will automatically detect the file
          format.

     description
          A long description of the file format.

     isa
          A function handle to confirm if a file is of the specified
          format.

     write
          A function handle to write if a file is of the specified
          format.

     read
          A function handle to open files the specified format.

     info
          A function handle to obtain image information of the specified
          format.

     alpha
          Logical value if format supports alpha channel (transparency
          or matte).

     multipage
          Logical value if format supports multipage (multiple images
          per file).

     It is possible to change the way Octave manages file formats with
     the options "add", "remove", and "update", and supplying a
     structure FORMAT with the required fields.  The option "factory"
     resets the configuration to the default.

     This can be used by Octave packages to extend the image reading
     capabilities Octave, through use of the PKG_ADD and PKG_DEL
     commands.

32.2 Displaying Images
======================

A natural part of image processing is visualization of an image.  The
most basic function for this is the ‘imshow’ function that shows the
image given in the first input argument.

 -- : imshow (IM)
 -- : imshow (IM, LIMITS)
 -- : imshow (IM, MAP)
 -- : imshow (RGB, ...)
 -- : imshow (FILENAME)
 -- : imshow (..., STRING_PARAM1, VALUE1, ...)
 -- : H = imshow (...)
     Display the image IM, where IM can be a 2-dimensional (grayscale
     image) or a 3-dimensional (RGB image) matrix.

     If LIMITS is a 2-element vector ‘[LOW, HIGH]’, the image is shown
     using a display range between LOW and HIGH.  If an empty matrix is
     passed for LIMITS, the display range is computed as the range
     between the minimal and the maximal value in the image.

     If MAP is a valid color map, the image will be shown as an indexed
     image using the supplied color map.

     If a filename is given instead of an image, the file will be read
     and shown.

     If given, the parameter STRING_PARAM1 has value VALUE1.
     STRING_PARAM1 can be any of the following:

     "displayrange"
          VALUE1 is the display range as described above.

     "colormap"
          VALUE1 is the colormap to use when displaying an indexed
          image.

     "xdata"
          If VALUE1 is a two element vector, it must contain horizontal
          axis limits in the form [xmin xmax]; Otherwise VALUE1 must be
          a vector and only the first and last elements will be used for
          xmin and xmax respectively.

     "ydata"
          If VALUE1 is a two element vector, it must contain vertical
          axis limits in the form [ymin ymax]; Otherwise VALUE1 must be
          a vector and only the first and last elements will be used for
          ymin and ymax respectively.

     The optional return value H is a graphics handle to the image.

     See also: *note image: XREFimage, *note imagesc: XREFimagesc, *note
     colormap: XREFcolormap, *note gray2ind: XREFgray2ind, *note
     rgb2ind: XREFrgb2ind.

 -- : image (IMG)
 -- : image (X, Y, IMG)
 -- : image (..., "PROP", VAL, ...)
 -- : image ("PROP1", VAL1, ...)
 -- : H = image (...)
     Display a matrix as an indexed color image.

     The elements of IMG are indices into the current colormap.

     X and Y are optional 2-element vectors, ‘[min, max]’, which specify
     the range for the axis labels.  If a range is specified as
     ‘[max, min]’ then the image will be reversed along that axis.  For
     convenience, X and Y may be specified as N-element vectors matching
     the length of the data in IMG.  However, only the first and last
     elements will be used to determine the axis limits.  *Warning:* X
     and Y are ignored when using gnuplot 4.0 or earlier.

     Multiple property/value pairs may be specified for the image
     object, but they must appear in pairs.

     The optional return value H is a graphics handle to the image.

     Implementation Note: The origin (0, 0) for images is located in the
     upper left.  For ordinary plots, the origin is located in the lower
     left.  Octave handles this inversion by plotting the data normally,
     and then reversing the direction of the y-axis by setting the
     ‘ydir’ property to "reverse".  This has implications whenever an
     image and an ordinary plot need to be overlaid.  The recommended
     solution is to display the image and then plot the reversed ydata
     using, for example, ‘flipud (ydata)’.

     Calling Forms: The ‘image’ function can be called in two forms:
     High-Level and Low-Level.  When invoked with normal options, the
     High-Level form is used which first calls ‘newplot’ to prepare the
     graphic figure and axes.  When the only inputs to ‘image’ are
     property/value pairs the Low-Level form is used which creates a new
     instance of an image object and inserts it in the current axes.

     See also: *note imshow: XREFimshow, *note imagesc: XREFimagesc,
     *note colormap: XREFcolormap.

 -- : imagesc (IMG)
 -- : imagesc (X, Y, IMG)
 -- : imagesc (..., CLIMITS)
 -- : imagesc (..., "PROP", VAL, ...)
 -- : imagesc ("PROP1", VAL1, ...)
 -- : imagesc (HAX, ...)
 -- : H = imagesc (...)
     Display a scaled version of the matrix IMG as a color image.

     The colormap is scaled so that the entries of the matrix occupy the
     entire colormap.  If ‘CLIMITS = [LO, HI]’ is given, then that range
     is set to the "clim" of the current axes.

     The axis values corresponding to the matrix elements are specified
     in X and Y, either as pairs giving the minimum and maximum values
     for the respective axes, or as values for each row and column of
     the matrix IMG.

     The optional return value H is a graphics handle to the image.

     Calling Forms: The ‘imagesc’ function can be called in two forms:
     High-Level and Low-Level.  When invoked with normal options, the
     High-Level form is used which first calls ‘newplot’ to prepare the
     graphic figure and axes.  When the only inputs to ‘image’ are
     property/value pairs the Low-Level form is used which creates a new
     instance of an image object and inserts it in the current axes.

32.3 Representing Images
========================

In general Octave supports four different kinds of images, grayscale
images, RGB images, binary images, and indexed images.  A grayscale
image is represented with an M-by-N matrix in which each element
corresponds to the intensity of a pixel.  An RGB image is represented
with an M-by-N-by-3 array where each 3-vector corresponds to the red,
green, and blue intensities of each pixel.

   The actual meaning of the value of a pixel in a grayscale or RGB
image depends on the class of the matrix.  If the matrix is of class
‘double’ pixel intensities are between 0 and 1, if it is of class
‘uint8’ intensities are between 0 and 255, and if it is of class
‘uint16’ intensities are between 0 and 65535.

   A binary image is an M-by-N matrix of class ‘logical’.  A pixel in a
binary image is black if it is ‘false’ and white if it is ‘true’.

   An indexed image consists of an M-by-N matrix of integers and a
C-by-3 color map.  Each integer corresponds to an index in the color
map, and each row in the color map corresponds to an RGB color.  The
color map must be of class ‘double’ with values between 0 and 1.

 -- : im2double (IMG)
 -- : im2double (IMG, "indexed")
     Convert image to double precision.

     The conversion of IMG to double precision, is dependent on the type
     of input image.  The following input classes are supported:

     ‘uint8, uint16, and int16’
          The range of values from the class is scaled to the interval
          [0 1].

     ‘logical’
          True and false values are assigned a value of 0 and 1
          respectively.

     ‘single’
          Values are cast to double.

     ‘double’
          Returns the same image.

     If IMG is an indexed image, then the second argument should be the
     string "indexed".  If so, then IMG must either be of floating point
     class, or unsigned integer class and it will simply be cast to
     double.  If it is an integer class, a +1 offset is applied.

     See also: *note double: XREFdouble.

 -- : iscolormap (CMAP)
     Return true if CMAP is a colormap.

     A colormap is a real matrix, of class single or double, with 3
     columns.  Each row represents a single color.  The 3 columns
     contain red, green, and blue intensities respectively.

     All values in a colormap should be in the [0 1] range but this is
     not enforced.  Each function must decide what to do for values
     outside this range.

     See also: *note colormap: XREFcolormap, *note rgbplot: XREFrgbplot.

 -- : IMG = gray2ind (I)
 -- : IMG = gray2ind (I, N)
 -- : IMG = gray2ind (BW)
 -- : IMG = gray2ind (BW, N)
 -- : [IMG, MAP] = gray2ind (...)
     Convert a grayscale or binary intensity image to an indexed image.

     The indexed image will consist of N different intensity values.  If
     not given N defaults to 64 for grayscale images or 2 for binary
     black and white images.

     The output IMG is of class uint8 if N is less than or equal to 256;
     Otherwise the return class is uint16.

     See also: *note ind2gray: XREFind2gray, *note rgb2ind: XREFrgb2ind.

 -- : I = ind2gray (X, MAP)
     Convert a color indexed image to a grayscale intensity image.

     The image X must be an indexed image which will be converted using
     the colormap CMAP.  If CMAP does not contain enough colors for the
     image, pixels in X outside the range are mapped to the last color
     in the map before conversion to grayscale.

     The output I is of the same class as the input X and may be one of
     ‘uint8’, ‘uint16’, ‘single’, or ‘double’.

     Implementation Note: There are several ways of converting colors to
     grayscale intensities.  This functions uses the luminance value
     obtained from ‘rgb2ntsc’ which is ‘I = 0.299*R + 0.587*G +
     0.114*B’.  Other possibilities include the value component from
     ‘rgb2hsv’ or using a single color channel from ‘ind2rgb’.

     See also: *note gray2ind: XREFgray2ind, *note ind2rgb: XREFind2rgb.

 -- : [X, MAP] = rgb2ind (RGB)
 -- : [X, MAP] = rgb2ind (R, G, B)
     Convert an image in red-green-blue (RGB) color space to an indexed
     image.

     The input image RGB can be specified as a single matrix of size
     MxNx3, or as three separate variables, R, G, and B, its three color
     channels, red, green, and blue.

     It outputs an indexed image X and a colormap MAP to interpret an
     image exactly the same as the input.  No dithering or other form of
     color quantization is performed.  The output class of the indexed
     image X can be uint8, uint16 or double, whichever is required to
     specify the number of unique colors in the image (which will be
     equal to the number of rows in MAP) in order

     Multi-dimensional indexed images (of size MxNx3xK) are also
     supported, both via a single input (RGB) or its three color
     channels as separate variables.

     See also: *note ind2rgb: XREFind2rgb, *note rgb2hsv: XREFrgb2hsv,
     *note rgb2ntsc: XREFrgb2ntsc.

 -- : RGB = ind2rgb (X, MAP)
 -- : [R, G, B] = ind2rgb (X, MAP)
     Convert an indexed image to red, green, and blue color components.

     The image X must be an indexed image which will be converted using
     the colormap MAP.  If MAP does not contain enough colors for the
     image, pixels in X outside the range are mapped to the last color
     in the map.

     The output may be a single RGB image (MxNx3 matrix where M and N
     are the original image X dimensions, one for each of the red, green
     and blue channels).  Alternatively, the individual red, green, and
     blue color matrices of size MxN may be returned.

     Multi-dimensional indexed images (of size MxNx1xK) are also
     supported.

 -- : CMAP = colormap (MAP)
 -- : CMAP = colormap ("default")
 -- : CMAP = colormap (MAP_NAME)
 -- : CMAP = colormap (HAX, ...)

     With no input arguments, ‘colormap’ returns the current color map.

     ‘colormap (MAP)’ sets the current colormap to MAP.  The colormap
     should be an N row by 3 column matrix.  The columns contain red,
     green, and blue intensities respectively.  All entries must be
     between 0 and 1 inclusive.  The new colormap is returned.

     ‘colormap ("default")’ restores the default colormap (the ‘viridis’
     map with 64 entries).  The default colormap is returned.

     The map may also be specified by a string, MAP_NAME, which is the
     name of a function that returns a colormap.

     If the first argument HAX is an axes handle, then the colormap for
     the parent figure of HAX is queried or set.

     For convenience, it is also possible to use this function with the
     command form, ‘colormap MAP_NAME’.

 -- : rgbplot (CMAP)
 -- : rgbplot (CMAP, STYLE)
 -- : H = rgbplot (...)
     Plot the components of a colormap.

     Two different STYLEs are available for displaying the CMAP:

     profile (default)
          Plot the RGB line profile of the colormap for each of the
          channels (red, green and blue) with the plot lines colored
          appropriately.  Each line represents the intensity of each RGB
          components across the colormap.

     composite
          Draw the colormap across the X-axis so that the actual index
          colors are visible rather than the individual color
          components.

     The optional return value H is a graphics handle to the created
     plot.

     Run ‘demo rgbplot’ to see an example of ‘rgbplot’ and each style
     option.

 -- : MAP = colorcube (N)
     Create color colormap.  This colormap is composed of as many
     equally spaced colors (not grays) in the RGB color space as
     possible.

     If there are not a perfect number N of regularly spaced colors then
     the remaining entries in the colormap are gradients of pure red,
     green, blue, and gray.

     The argument N must be a scalar.  If unspecified, the length of the

 -- : MAP = cubehelix (N)
     Create cubehelix colormap.

     This colormap varies from black to white going though blue, green,
     and red tones while maintaining a monotonically increasing
     perception of intensity.  This is achieved by traversing a color
     cube from black to white through a helix, hence the name cubehelix,
     while taking into account the perceived brightness of each channel
     according to the NTSC specifications from 1953.

     See also: *note colormap: XREFcolormap.

 -- : CMAP = contrast (X)
 -- : CMAP = contrast (X, N)
     Return a gray colormap that maximizes the contrast in an image.

     The returned colormap will have N rows.  If N is not defined then
     the size of the current colormap is used.

     See also: *note colormap: XREFcolormap, *note brighten:
     XREFbrighten.

   The following three functions modify the existing colormap rather
than replace it.

 -- : MAP_OUT = brighten (BETA)
 -- : MAP_OUT = brighten (MAP, BETA)
 -- : MAP_OUT = brighten (H, BETA)
 -- : brighten (...)
     Brighten or darken a colormap.

     The argument BETA must be a scalar between -1 and 1, where a
     negative value darkens and a positive value brightens the colormap.

     If the MAP argument is omitted, the function is applied to the
     current colormap.

     The first argument can also be a valid graphics handle H, in which
     case ‘brighten’ is applied to the colormap associated with this
     handle.

     If no output is specified then the result is written to the current

 -- : spinmap ()
 -- : spinmap (T)
 -- : spinmap (T, INC)
 -- : spinmap ("inf")
     Cycle the colormap for T seconds with a color increment of INC.

     Both parameters are optional.  The default cycle time is 5 seconds
     and the default increment is 2.  If the option "inf" is given then
     cycle continuously until ‘Control-C’ is pressed.

     When rotating, the original color 1 becomes color 2, color 2
     becomes color 3, etc.  A positive or negative increment is allowed
     and a higher value of INC will cause faster cycling through the
     colormap.

     See also: *note colormap: XREFcolormap.

 -- : whitebg ()
 -- : whitebg (COLOR)
 -- : whitebg ("none")
 -- : whitebg (HFIG, ...)
     Invert the colors in the current color scheme.

     The root properties are also inverted such that all subsequent plot
     use the new color scheme.

     If the optional argument COLOR is present then the background color
     is set to COLOR rather than inverted.  COLOR may be a string
     representing one of the eight known colors or an RGB triplet.  The
     special string argument "none" restores the plot to the default
     colors.

     If the first argument HFIG is a figure handle, then operate on this
     figure rather than the current figure returned by ‘gcf’.  The root
     properties will not be changed.

     See also: *note reset: XREFreset, *note get: XREFget, *note set:
     XREFset.

   The following functions can be used to manipulate colormaps.

 -- : [Y, NEWMAP] = cmunique (X, MAP)
 -- : [Y, NEWMAP] = cmunique (RGB)
 -- : [Y, NEWMAP] = cmunique (I)
     Convert an input image X to an ouput indexed image Y which uses the
     smallest colormap possible NEWMAP.

     When the input is an indexed image (X with colormap MAP) the output
     is a colormap NEWMAP from which any repeated rows have been
     eliminated.  The output image, Y, is the original input image with
     the indices adjusted to match the new, possibly smaller, colormap.

     When the input is an RGB image (an MxNx3 array), the output
     colormap will contain one entry for every unique color in the
     original image.  In the worst case the new map could have as many
     rows as the number of pixels in the original image.

     When the input is a grayscale image I, the output colormap will
     contain one entry for every unique intensity value in the original
     image.  In the worst case the new map could have as many rows as
     the number of pixels in the original image.

     Implementation Details:

     NEWMAP is always an Mx3 matrix, even if the input image is an
     intensity grayscale image I (all three RGB planes are assigned the
     same value).

     The output image is of class uint8 if the size of the new colormap
     is less than or equal to 256.  Otherwise, the output image is of
     class double.

     See also: *note rgb2ind: XREFrgb2ind, *note gray2ind: XREFgray2ind.

 -- : [Y, NEWMAP] = cmpermute (X, MAP)
 -- : [Y, NEWMAP] = cmpermute (X, MAP, INDEX)
     Reorder colors in a colormap.

     When called with only two arguments, ‘cmpermute’ randomly
     rearranges the colormap MAP and returns a new colormap NEWMAP.  It
     also returns the indexed image Y which is the equivalent of the
     original input image X when displayed using NEWMAP.

     When called with an optional third argument the order of colors in
     the new colormap is defined by INDEX.

     *Caution:* ‘index’ should not have repeated elements or the
     function will fail.

32.4 Plotting on top of Images
==============================

If gnuplot is being used to display images it is possible to plot on top
of images.  Since an image is a matrix it is indexed by row and column
values.  The plotting system is, however, based on the traditional (x,
y) system.  To minimize the difference between the two systems Octave
places the origin of the coordinate system in the point corresponding to
the pixel at (1, 1).  So, to plot points given by row and column values
on top of an image, one should simply call ‘plot’ with the column values
as the first argument and the row values as the second.  As an example
the following code generates an image with random intensities between 0
and 1, and shows the image with red circles over pixels with an
intensity above 0.99.

     I = rand (100, 100);
     [row, col] = find (I > 0.99);
     hold ("on");
     imshow (I);
     plot (col, row, "ro");
     hold ("off");

32.5 Color Conversion
=====================

Octave supports conversion from the RGB color system to NTSC and HSV and
vice versa.

 -- : HSV_MAP = rgb2hsv (RGB)
 -- : HSV_MAP = rgb2hsv (RGB)
     Transform a colormap or image from RGB to HSV color space.

     A color in the RGB space consists of red, green, and blue
     intensities.

     A color in HSV space is represented by hue, saturation and value
     (brightness) levels in a cylindrical coordinate system.  Hue is the
     azimuth and describes the dominant color.  Saturation is the radial
     distance and gives the amount of hue mixed into the color.  Value
     is the height and is the amount of light in the color.

     Output class and size will be the same as input.

     See also: *note hsv2rgb: XREFhsv2rgb, *note rgb2ind: XREFrgb2ind,
     *note rgb2ntsc: XREFrgb2ntsc.

 -- : RGB_MAP = hsv2rgb (HSV_MAP)
 -- : RGB_IMG = hsv2rgb (HSV_IMG)
     Transform a colormap or image from HSV to RGB color space.

     A color in HSV space is represented by hue, saturation and value
     (brightness) levels in a cylindrical coordinate system.  Hue is the
     azimuth and describes the dominant color.  Saturation is the radial
     distance and gives the amount of hue mixed into the color.  Value
     is the height and is the amount of light in the color.

     The input can be both a colormap or RGB image.  In the case of
     floating point input, values are expected to be on the [0 1] range.
     In the case of hue (azimuth), since the value corresponds to an
     angle, ‘mod (h, 1)’ is used.

          >> hsv2rgb ([0.5 1 1])
          ⇒ ans = 0 1 1

          >> hsv2rgb ([2.5 1 1])
          ⇒ ans = 0 1 1

          >> hsv2rgb ([3.5 1 1])
          ⇒ ans = 0 1 1

     Output class and size will be the same as input.

     *note ntsc2rgb: XREFntsc2rgb.

 -- : YIQ_MAP = rgb2ntsc (RGB_MAP)
 -- : YIQ_IMG = rgb2ntsc (RGB_IMG)
     Transform a colormap or image from red-green-blue (RGB) color space
     to luminance-chrominance (NTSC) space.  The input may be of class
     uint8, uint16, single, or double.  The output is of class double.

     Implementation Note: The reference matrix for the transformation is

          /Y\     0.299  0.587  0.114  /R\
          |I|  =  0.596 -0.274 -0.322  |G|
          \Q/     0.211 -0.523  0.312  \B/

     as documented in <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YIQ> and truncated
     to 3 significant figures.  Note: The FCC version of NTSC uses only
     2 significant digits and is slightly different.

     See also: *note ntsc2rgb: XREFntsc2rgb, *note rgb2hsv: XREFrgb2hsv,
     *note rgb2ind: XREFrgb2ind.

 -- : RGB_MAP = ntsc2rgb (YIQ_MAP)
 -- : RGB_IMG = ntsc2rgb (YIQ_IMG)
     Transform a colormap or image from luminance-chrominance (NTSC)
     space to red-green-blue (RGB) color space.

     Implementation Note: The conversion matrix is chosen to be the
     inverse of the matrix used for rgb2ntsc such that

          x == ntsc2rgb (rgb2ntsc (x))

     MATLAB uses a slightly different matrix where rounding means the
     equality above does not hold.

33.1 Audio File Utilities
=========================

The following functions allow you to read, write and retrieve
information about audio files.  Various formats are supported including
wav, flac and ogg vorbis.

 -- : INFO = audioinfo (FILENAME)
     Return information about an audio file specified by FILENAME.

 -- : [Y, FS] = audioread (FILENAME)
 -- : [Y, FS] = audioread (FILENAME, SAMPLES)

 -- : [Y, FS] = audioread (FILENAME, SAMPLES, DATATYPE)
     Read the audio file FILENAME and return the audio data Y and
     sampling rate FS.

     The audio data is stored as matrix with rows corresponding to audio
     frames and columns corresponding to channels.

     The optional two-element vector argument SAMPLES specifies starting
     and ending frames.

     The optional argument DATATYPE specifies the datatype to return.
     If it is "native", then the type of data depends on how the data is
     stored in the audio file.

 -- : ID = audiodevinfo (IO, NAME)
 -- : ID = audiodevinfo (IO, RATE, BITS, CHANS)

 -- : SUPPORTS = audiodevinfo (IO, ID, RATE, BITS, CHANS)

     Return a structure describing the available audio input and output
     devices.

     The DEVINFO structure has two fields "input" and "output".  The
     value of each field is a structure array with fields "Name",
     "DriverVersion" and "ID" describing an audio device.

     If the optional argument IO is 1, return information about input
     devices only.  If it is 0, return information about output devices
     only.

     If the optional argument ID is provided, return information about
     the corresponding device.

     If the optional argument NAME is provided, return the id of the
     named device.

     Given a sampling rate, bits per sample, and number of channels for
     an input or output device, return the ID of the first device that
     supports playback or recording using the specified parameters.

     If also given a device ID, return true if the device supports
     playback or recording using those parameters.

33.3 Audio Player
=================

The following methods are used to create and use audioplayer objects.
These objects can be used to play back audio data stored in Octave
matrices and arrays.  The audioplayer object supports playback from
various devices available to the system, blocking and non-blocking
playback, convenient pausing and resuming and much more.

 -- : PLAYER = audioplayer (Y, FS)
 -- : PLAYER = audioplayer (Y, FS, NBITS)
 -- : PLAYER = audioplayer (Y, FS, NBITS, ID)
 -- : PLAYER = audioplayer (RECORDER)
 -- : PLAYER = audioplayer (RECORDER, ID)
     Create an audioplayer object that will play back data Y at sample
     rate FS.

     The optional arguments NBITS, and ID specify the bit depth and
     player device id, respectively.  Device IDs may be found using the
     audiodevinfo function.  Given an audioplayer object, use the data
     from the object to initialize the player.

     The signal Y can be a vector or a two-dimensional array.

     The following example will create an audioplayer object that will
     play back one second of white noise at 44100 sample rate using 8
     bits per sample.

          y = randn (2, 44100) - 0.5;
          player = audioplayer (y, 44100, 8);

33.5 Audio Data Processing
==========================

Octave provides a few functions for dealing with audio data.  An audio
‘sample’ is a single output value from an A/D converter, i.e., a small
integer number (usually 8 or 16 bits), and audio data is just a series
of such samples.  It can be characterized by three parameters: the
sampling rate (measured in samples per second or Hz, e.g., 8000 or
44100), the number of bits per sample (e.g., 8 or 16), and the number of
channels (1 for mono, 2 for stereo, etc.).

   There are many different formats for representing such data.
Currently, only the two most popular, _linear encoding_ and _mu-law
encoding_, are supported by Octave.  There is an excellent FAQ on audio
formats by Guido van Rossum <guido@cwi.nl> which can be found at any FAQ
ftp site, in particular in the directory
‘/pub/usenet/news.answers/audio-fmts’ of the archive site
‘rtfm.mit.edu’.

   Octave simply treats audio data as vectors of samples (non-mono data
are not supported yet).  It is assumed that audio files using linear
encoding have one of the extensions ‘lin’ or ‘raw’, and that files
holding data in mu-law encoding end in ‘au’, ‘mu’, or ‘snd’.

 -- : lin2mu (X, N)
     Convert audio data from linear to mu-law.

     Mu-law values use 8-bit unsigned integers.  Linear values use N-bit
     signed integers or floating point values in the range -1 ≤ X ≤ 1 if
     N is 0.

     If N is not specified it defaults to 0, 8, or 16 depending on the
     range of values in X.

     See also: *note mu2lin: XREFmu2lin.

 -- : mu2lin (X, N)
     Convert audio data from mu-law to linear.

     Mu-law values are 8-bit unsigned integers.  Linear values use N-bit
     signed integers or floating point values in the range -1≤y≤1 if N
     is 0.

     If N is not specified it defaults to 0.

     See also: *note lin2mu: XREFlin2mu.

 -- : record (SEC)
 -- : record (SEC, FS)
     Record SEC seconds of audio from the system’s default audio input
     at a sampling rate of 8000 samples per second.

     If the optional argument FS is given, it specifies the sampling
     rate for recording.

     For more control over audio recording, use the ‘audiorecorder’
     class.

     See also: *note sound: XREFsound, *note soundsc: XREFsoundsc.

 -- : sound (Y)
 -- : sound (Y, FS)
 -- : sound (Y, FS, NBITS)
     Play audio data Y at sample rate FS to the default audio device.

     The audio signal Y can be a vector or a two-column array,
     representing mono or stereo audio, respectively.

     If FS is not given, a default sample rate of 8000 samples per
     second is used.

     The optional argument NBITS specifies the bit depth to play to the
     audio device and defaults to 8 bits.

     For more control over audio playback, use the ‘audioplayer’ class.

     See also: *note soundsc: XREFsoundsc, *note record: XREFrecord.

 -- : soundsc (Y)
 -- : soundsc (Y, FS)
 -- : soundsc (Y, FS, NBITS)
 -- : soundsc (..., [YMIN, YMAX])
     Scale the audio data Y and play it at sample rate FS to the default
     audio device.

     The audio signal Y can be a vector or a two-column array,
     representing mono or stereo audio, respectively.

     If FS is not given, a default sample rate of 8000 samples per
     second is used.

     The optional argument NBITS specifies the bit depth to play to the
     audio device and defaults to 8 bits.

     By default, Y is automatically normalized to the range [-1, 1].  If
     the range [YMIN, YMAX] is given, then elements of Y that fall
     within the range YMIN ≤ Y ≤ YMAX are scaled to the range [-1, 1]
     instead.

     For more control over audio playback, use the ‘audioplayer’ class.

34 Object Oriented Programming
******************************

Octave has the ability to create user-defined classes—including the
capabilities of operator and function overloading.  Classes can protect
internal properties so that they may not be altered accidentally which
facilitates data encapsulation.  In addition, rules can be created to
address the issue of class precedence in mixed class operations.

   This chapter discusses the means of constructing a user class, how to
query and set the properties of a class, and how to overload operators
and functions.  Throughout this chapter real code examples are given
using a class designed for polynomials.

File: octave.info,  Node: Creating a Class,  Next: Class Methods,  Up: Object Oriented Programming

34.1 Creating a Class
=====================

This chapter illustrates user-defined classes and object oriented
programming through a custom class designed for polynomials.  This class
was chosen for its simplicity which does not distract unnecessarily from
the discussion of the programming features of Octave.  Even so, a bit of
background on the goals of the polynomial class is necessary before the
syntax and techniques of Octave object oriented programming are
introduced.

   The polynomial class is used to represent polynomials of the form

     a0 + a1 * x + a2 * x^2 + ... + an * x^n

where a0, a1, etc. are real scalars.  Thus the polynomial can be
represented by a vector

     a = [a0, a1, a2, ..., an];

   This is a sufficient specification to begin writing the constructor
for the polynomial class.  All object oriented classes in Octave must be
located in a directory that is the name of the class prepended with the
‘@’ symbol.  For example, the polynomial class will have all of its
methods defined in the ‘@polynomial’ directory.

   The constructor for the class must be the name of the class itself;
in this example the constructor resides in the file
‘@polynomial/polynomial.m’.  Ideally, even when the constructor is
called with no arguments it should return a valid object.  A constructor
for the polynomial class might look like

     ## -*- texinfo -*-
     ## @deftypefn  {} {} polynomial ()
     ## @deftypefnx {} {} polynomial (@var{a})
     ## Create a polynomial object representing the polynomial
     ##
     ## @example
     ## a0 + a1 * x + a2 * x^2 + @dots{} + an * x^n
     ## @end example
     ##
     ## @noindent
     ## from a vector of coefficients [a0 a1 a2 @dots{} an].
     ## @end deftypefn

     function p = polynomial (a)

       if (nargin > 1)
         print_usage ();
       endif

       if (nargin == 0)
         p.poly = [0];
         p = class (p, "polynomial");
       else
         if (strcmp (class (a), "polynomial"))
           p = a;
         elseif (isreal (a) && isvector (a))
           p.poly = a(:).';  # force row vector
           p = class (p, "polynomial");
         else
           error ("@polynomial: A must be a real vector");
         endif
       endif

     endfunction

   Note that the return value of the constructor must be the output of
the ‘class’ function.  The first argument to the ‘class’ function is a
structure and the second is the name of the class itself.  An example of
calling the class constructor to create an instance is

     p = polynomial ([1, 0, 1]);

   Methods are defined by m-files in the class directory and can have
embedded documentation the same as any other m-file.  The help for the
constructor can be obtained by using the constructor name alone, that
is, for the polynomial constructor ‘help polynomial’ will return the
help string.  Help can be restricted to a particular class by using the
class directory name followed by the method.  For example, ‘help
@polynomial/polynomial’ is another way of displaying the help string for
the polynomial constructor.  This second means is the only way to obtain
help for the overloaded methods and functions of a class.

   The same specification mechanism can be used wherever Octave expects
a function name.  For example ‘type @polynomial/display’ will print the
code of the display method of the polynomial class to the screen, and
‘dbstop @polynomial/display’ will set a breakpoint at the first
executable line of the display method of the polynomial class.

   To check whether a variable belongs to a user class, the ‘isobject’
and ‘isa’ functions can be used.  For example:

     p = polynomial ([1, 0, 1]);
     isobject (p)
       ⇒ 1
     isa (p, "polynomial")
       ⇒ 1

 -- : isobject (X)
     Return true if X is a class object.

     See also: *note class: XREFclass, *note typeinfo: XREFtypeinfo,
     *note isa: XREFisa, *note ismethod: XREFismethod, *note isprop:
     XREFisprop.

The available methods of a class can be displayed with the ‘methods’
function.

 -- : methods (OBJ)
 -- : methods ("CLASSNAME")
 -- : MTDS = methods (...)

     Return a cell array containing the names of the methods for the
     object OBJ or the named class CLASSNAME.

     OBJ may be an Octave class object or a Java object.

     See also: *note fieldnames: XREFfieldnames.

To inquire whether a particular method exists for a user class, the
‘ismethod’ function can be used.

 -- : ismethod (OBJ, METHOD)
 -- : ismethod (CLSNAME, METHOD)
     Return true if the string METHOD is a valid method of the object
     OBJ or of the class CLSNAME.

     See also: *note isprop: XREFisprop, *note isobject: XREFisobject.

For example:

     p = polynomial ([1, 0, 1]);
     ismethod (p, "roots")
       ⇒ 1

34.2 Class Methods
==================

There are a number of basic class methods that can (and should) be
defined to allow the contents of the classes to be queried and set.  The
most basic of these is the ‘display’ method.  The ‘display’ method is
used by Octave whenever a class should be displayed on the screen.
Usually this is the result of an Octave expression that doesn’t end with
a semicolon.  If this method is not defined, then Octave won’t print
anything when displaying the contents of a class which can be confusing.

 -- : display (OBJ)
     Display the contents of the object OBJ.

     The Octave interpreter calls the ‘display’ function whenever it
     needs to present a class on-screen.  Typically, this would be a
     statement which does not end in a semicolon to suppress output.
     For example:

          myobj = myclass (...)

     User-defined classes should overload the ‘display’ method so that
     something useful is printed for a class object.  Otherwise, Octave
     will report only that the object is an instance of its class.

          myobj = myclass (...)
            ⇒ myobj = <class myclass>

     See also: *note class: XREFclass, *note subsref: XREFsubsref, *note
     subsasgn: XREFsubsasgn.

An example of a display method for the polynomial class might be

     function display (p)

       printf ("%s =", inputname (1));

       a = p.poly;
       first = true;
       for i = 1 : length (a);
         if (a(i) != 0)
           if (first)
             first = false;
           elseif (a(i) > 0 || isnan (a(i)))
             printf (" +");
           endif
           if (a(i) < 0)
             printf (" -");
           endif
           if (i == 1)
             printf (" %.5g", abs (a(i)));
           elseif (abs (a(i)) != 1)
             printf (" %.5g *", abs (a(i)));
           endif
           if (i > 1)
             printf (" X");
           endif
           if (i > 2)
             printf (" ^ %d", i - 1);
           endif
         endif
       endfor

       if (first)
         printf (" 0");
       endif
       printf ("\n");

     endfunction

Note that in the display method it makes sense to start the method with
the line ‘printf ("%s =", inputname (1))’ to be consistent with the rest
of Octave which prints the variable name to be displayed followed by the
value.

   To be consistent with the Octave graphic handle classes, a class
should also define the ‘get’ and ‘set’ methods.  The ‘get’ method
accepts one or two arguments.  The first argument is an object of the
appropriate class.  If no second argument is given then the method
should return a structure with all the properties of the class.  If the
optional second argument is given it should be a property name and the
specified property should be retrieved.

     function val = get (p, prop)

       if (nargin < 1 || nargin > 2)
         print_usage ();
       endif

       if (nargin == 1)
         val.poly = p.poly;
       else
         if (! ischar (prop))
           error ("@polynomial/get: PROPERTY must be a string");
         endif

         switch (prop)
           case "poly"
             val = p.poly;
           otherwise
             error ('@polynomial/get: invalid PROPERTY "%s"', prop);
         endswitch
       endif

     endfunction

Similarly, the first argument to the ‘set’ method should be an object
and any additional arguments should be property/value pairs.

     function pout = set (p, varargin)

       if (numel (varargin) < 2 || rem (numel (varargin), 2) != 0)
         error ("@polynomial/set: expecting PROPERTY/VALUE pairs");
       endif

       pout = p;
       while (numel (varargin) > 1)
         prop = varargin{1};
         val  = varargin{2};
         varargin(1:2) = [];
         if (! ischar (prop) || ! strcmp (prop, "poly"))
           error ("@polynomial/set: invalid PROPERTY for polynomial class");
         elseif (! (isreal (val) && isvector (val)))
           error ("@polynomial/set: VALUE must be a real vector");
         endif

         pout.poly = val(:).';  # force row vector
       endwhile

     endfunction

Note that Octave does not implement pass by reference; Therefore, to
modify an object requires an assignment statement using the return value
from the ‘set’ method.

     p = set (p, "poly", [1, 0, 0, 0, 1]);

The ‘set’ method makes use of the ‘subsasgn’ method of the class, and
therefore this method must also be defined.  The ‘subsasgn’ method is
discussed more thoroughly in the next section (*note Indexing
Objects::).

   Finally, user classes can be considered to be a special type of a
structure, and they can be saved to a file in the same manner as a
structure.  For example:

     p = polynomial ([1, 0, 1]);
     save userclass.mat p
     clear p
     load userclass.mat

All of the file formats supported by ‘save’ and ‘load’ are supported.
In certain circumstances a user class might contain a field that it
doesn’t make sense to save, or a field that needs to be initialized
before it is saved.  This can be done with the ‘saveobj’ method of the
class.

 -- : B = saveobj (A)
     Method of a class to manipulate an object prior to saving it to a
     file.

     The function ‘saveobj’ is called when the object A is saved using
     the ‘save’ function.  An example of the use of ‘saveobj’ might be
     to remove fields of the object that don’t make sense to be saved or
     it might be used to ensure that certain fields of the object are
     initialized before the object is saved.  For example:

          function b = saveobj (a)
            b = a;
            if (isempty (b.field))
               b.field = initfield (b);
            endif
          endfunction

     See also: *note loadobj: XREFloadobj, *note class: XREFclass.

‘saveobj’ is called just prior to saving the class to a file.
Similarly, the ‘loadobj’ method is called just after a class is loaded
from a file, and can be used to ensure that any removed fields are
reinserted into the user object.

 -- : B = loadobj (A)
     Method of a class to manipulate an object after loading it from a
     file.

     The function ‘loadobj’ is called when the object A is loaded using
     the ‘load’ function.  An example of the use of ‘saveobj’ might be
     to add fields to an object that don’t make sense to be saved.  For
     example:

          function b = loadobj (a)
            b = a;
            b.addmissingfield = addfield (b);
          endfunction

34.3.1 Defining Indexing And Indexed Assignment
-----------------------------------------------

Objects can be indexed with parentheses or braces, either like
‘OBJ(IDX)’ or like ‘OBJ{IDX}’, or even like ‘OBJ(IDX).FIELD’.  However,
it is up to the programmer to decide what this indexing actually means.
In the case of the polynomial class ‘P(N)’ might mean either the
coefficient of the N-th power of the polynomial, or it might be the
evaluation of the polynomial at N.  The meaning of this subscripted
referencing is determined by the ‘subsref’ method.

 -- : subsref (VAL, IDX)
     Perform the subscripted element selection operation on VAL
     according to the subscript specified by IDX.

     The subscript IDX must be a structure array with fields ‘type’ and
     ‘subs’.  Valid values for ‘type’ are "()", "{}", and ".".  The
     ‘subs’ field may be either ":" or a cell array of index values.

     The following example shows how to extract the first two columns of
     a matrix

          val = magic (3)
              ⇒ val = [ 8   1   6
                         3   5   7
                         4   9   2 ]
          idx.type = "()";
          idx.subs = {":", 1:2};
          subsref (val, idx)
               ⇒ [ 8   1
                    3   5
                    4   9 ]

     Note that this is the same as writing ‘val(:, 1:2)’.

     If IDX is an empty structure array with fields ‘type’ and ‘subs’,
     return VAL.

     See also: *note subsasgn: XREFsubsasgn, *note substruct:
     XREFsubstruct.

   For example, this class uses the convention that indexing with "()"
evaluates the polynomial and indexing with "{}" returns the N-th
coefficient (of the N-th power).  The code for the ‘subsref’ method
looks like

     function r = subsref (p, s)

       if (isempty (s))
         error ("@polynomial/subsref: missing index");
       endif

       switch (s(1).type)

         case "()"
           idx = s(1).subs;
           if (numel (idx) != 1)
             error ("@polynomial/subsref: need exactly one index");
           endif
           r = polyval (fliplr (p.poly), idx{1});

         case "{}"
           idx = s(1).subs;
           if (numel (idx) != 1)
             error ("@polynomial/subsref: need exactly one index");
           endif

           if (isnumeric (idx{1}))
             r = p.poly(idx{1}+1);
           else
             r = p.poly(idx{1});
           endif

         case "."
           fld = s.subs;
           if (! strcmp (fld, "poly"))
             error ('@polynomial/subsref: invalid property "%s"', fld);
           endif
           r = p.poly;

         otherwise
           error ("@polynomial/subsref: invalid subscript type");

       endswitch

       if (numel (s) > 1)
         r = subsref (r, s(2:end));
       endif

     endfunction

   The equivalent functionality for subscripted assignments uses the
‘subsasgn’ method.

 -- : subsasgn (VAL, IDX, RHS)
     Perform the subscripted assignment operation according to the
     subscript specified by IDX.

     The subscript IDX must be a structure array with fields ‘type’ and
     ‘subs’.  Valid values for ‘type’ are "()", "{}", and ".".  The
     ‘subs’ field may be either ":" or a cell array of index values.

     The following example shows how to set the two first columns of a
     3-by-3 matrix to zero.

          val = magic (3);
          idx.type = "()";
          idx.subs = {":", 1:2};
          subsasgn (val, idx, 0)
               ⇒  [ 0   0   6
                     0   0   7
                     0   0   2 ]

     Note that this is the same as writing ‘val(:, 1:2) = 0’.

     If IDX is an empty structure array with fields ‘type’ and ‘subs’,
     return RHS.

     See also: *note subsref: XREFsubsref, *note substruct:
     XREFsubstruct, *note optimize_subsasgn_calls:
     XREFoptimize_subsasgn_calls.

 -- : VAL = optimize_subsasgn_calls ()
 -- : OLD_VAL = optimize_subsasgn_calls (NEW_VAL)
 -- : optimize_subsasgn_calls (NEW_VAL, "local")
     Query or set the internal flag for ‘subsasgn’ method call
     optimizations.

     If true, Octave will attempt to eliminate the redundant copying
     when calling the ‘subsasgn’ method of a user-defined class.

     When called from inside a function with the "local" option, the
     variable is changed locally for the function and any subroutines it
     calls.  The original variable value is restored when exiting the
     function.

     See also: *note subsasgn: XREFsubsasgn.

   Note that the ‘subsref’ and ‘subsasgn’ methods always receive the
whole index chain, while they usually handle only the first element.  It
is the responsibility of these methods to handle the rest of the chain
(if needed), usually by forwarding it again to ‘subsref’ or ‘subsasgn’.

   If you wish to use the ‘end’ keyword in subscripted expressions of an
object, then there must be an ‘end’ method defined.  For example, the
‘end’ method for the polynomial class might look like

     function r = end (obj, index_pos, num_indices)

       if (num_indices != 1)
         error ("polynomial object may only have one index");
       endif

       r = length (obj.poly) - 1;

     endfunction

which is a fairly generic ‘end’ method that has a behavior similar to
the ‘end’ keyword for Octave Array classes.  An example using the
polynomial class is then

     p = polynomial ([1,2,3,4]);
     p{end-1}
       ⇒ 3

   Objects can also be used themselves as the index in a subscripted
expression and this is controlled by the ‘subsindex’ function.

 -- : IDX = subsindex (OBJ)
     Convert an object to an index vector.

     When OBJ is a class object defined with a class constructor, then
     ‘subsindex’ is the overloading method that allows the conversion of
     this class object to a valid indexing vector.  It is important to
     note that ‘subsindex’ must return a zero-based real integer vector
     of the class "double".  For example, if the class constructor were

          function obj = myclass (a)
            obj = class (struct ("a", a), "myclass");
          endfunction

     then the ‘subsindex’ function

          function idx = subsindex (obj)
            idx = double (obj.a) - 1.0;
          endfunction

     could be used as follows

          a = myclass (1:4);
          b = 1:10;
          b(a)
          ⇒ 1  2  3  4

     See also: *note class: XREFclass, *note subsref: XREFsubsref, *note
     subsasgn: XREFsubsasgn.

   Finally, objects can be used like ranges by providing a ‘colon’
method.

 -- : R = colon (BASE, LIMIT)
 -- : R = colon (BASE, INCREMENT, LIMIT)
     Return the result of the colon expression corresponding to BASE,
     LIMIT, and optionally, INCREMENT.

     This function is equivalent to the operator syntax ‘base : limit’
     or ‘base : increment : limit’.

34.3.2 Indexed Assignment Optimization
--------------------------------------

Octave’s ubiquitous lazily-copied pass-by-value semantics implies a
problem for performance of user-defined ‘subsasgn’ methods.  Imagine the
following call to ‘subsasgn’

     ss = substruct ("()", {1});
     x = subsasgn (x, ss, 1);

where the corresponding method looking like this:

     function x = subsasgn (x, ss, val)
       ...
       x.myfield (ss.subs{1}) = val;
     endfunction

   The problem is that on entry to the ‘subsasgn’ method, ‘x’ is still
referenced from the caller’s scope, which means that the method will
first need to unshare (copy) ‘x’ and ‘x.myfield’ before performing the
assignment.  Upon completing the call, unless an error occurs, the
result is immediately assigned to ‘x’ in the caller’s scope, so that the
previous value of ‘x.myfield’ is forgotten.  Hence, the Octave language
implies a copy of N elements (N being the size of ‘x.myfield’), where
modifying just a single element would actually suffice.  In other words,
a constant-time operation is degraded to linear-time one.  This may be a
real problem for user classes that intrinsically store large arrays.

   To partially solve the problem Octave uses a special optimization for
user-defined ‘subsasgn’ methods coded as m-files.  When the method gets
called as a result of the built-in assignment syntax (not a direct
‘subsasgn’ call as shown above), i.e., ‘x(1) = 1’, AND if the ‘subsasgn’
method is declared with identical input and output arguments, as in the
example above, then Octave will ignore the copy of ‘x’ inside the
caller’s scope; therefore, any changes made to ‘x’ during the method
execution will directly affect the caller’s copy as well.  This allows,
for instance, defining a polynomial class where modifying a single
element takes constant time.

   It is important to understand the implications that this optimization
brings.  Since no extra copy of ‘x’ will exist in the caller’s scope, it
is _solely_ the callee’s responsibility to not leave ‘x’ in an invalid
state if an error occurs during the execution.  Also, if the method
partially changes ‘x’ and then errors out, the changes _will_ affect ‘x’
in the caller’s scope.  Deleting or completely replacing ‘x’ inside
subsasgn will not do anything, however, only indexed assignments matter.

   Since this optimization may change the way code works (especially if
badly written), a built-in variable ‘optimize_subsasgn_calls’ is
provided to control it.  It is on by default.  Another way to avoid the
optimization is to declare subsasgn methods with different output and
input arguments like this:

     function y = subsasgn (x, ss, val)
       ...
     endfunction

34.4.1 Function Overloading
---------------------------

Any Octave function can be overloaded, and this allows an
object-specific version of a function to be called as needed.  A
pertinent example for the polynomial class might be to overload the
‘polyval’ function.

     function [y, dy] = polyval (p, varargin)

       if (nargout > 1)
         [y, dy] = polyval (fliplr (p.poly), varargin{:});
       else
         y = polyval (fliplr (p.poly), varargin{:});
       endif

     endfunction

   This function just hands off the work to the normal Octave ‘polyval’
function.  Another interesting example of an overloaded function for the
polynomial class is the ‘plot’ function.

     function h = plot (p, varargin)

       n = 128;
       rmax = max (abs (roots (p.poly)));
       x = [0 : (n - 1)] / (n - 1) * 2.2 * rmax - 1.1 * rmax;
       if (nargout > 0)
         h = plot (x, polyval (p, x), varargin{:});
       else
         plot (x, polyval (p, x), varargin{:});
       endif

     endfunction

which allows polynomials to be plotted in the domain near the region of
the roots of the polynomial.

   Functions that are of particular interest for overloading are the
class conversion functions such as ‘double’.  Overloading these
functions allows the ‘cast’ function to work with a user class.  It can
also can aid in the use of a class object with methods and functions
from other classes since the object can be transformed to the requisite
input form for the new function.  An example ‘double’ function for the
polynomial class might look like

     function a = double (p)
       a = p.poly;
     endfunction

34.4.3 Precedence of Objects
----------------------------

Many functions and operators take two or more arguments and the
situation can easily arise where these functions are called with objects
of different classes.  It is therefore necessary to determine the
precedence of which method from which class to call when there are mixed
objects given to a function or operator.  To do this the ‘superiorto’
and ‘inferiorto’ functions can be used

 -- : superiorto (CLASS_NAME, ...)
     When called from a class constructor, mark the object currently
     constructed as having a higher precedence than CLASS_NAME.

     More that one such class can be specified in a single call.  This
     function may _only_ be called from a class constructor.

     See also: *note inferiorto: XREFinferiorto.

 -- : inferiorto (CLASS_NAME, ...)
     When called from a class constructor, mark the object currently
     constructed as having a lower precedence than CLASS_NAME.

     More that one such class can be specified in a single call.  This
     function may _only_ be called from a class constructor.

     See also: *note superiorto: XREFsuperiorto.

   With the polynomial class, consider the case

     2 * polynomial ([1, 0, 1]);

that mixes an object of the class "double" with an object of the class
"polynomial".  In this case the return type should be "polynomial" and
so the ‘superiorto’ function is used in the class constructor.  In
particular the polynomial class constructor would be modified to

     ## -*- texinfo -*-
     ## @deftypefn  {} {} polynomial ()
     ## @deftypefnx {} {} polynomial (@var{a})
     ## Create a polynomial object representing the polynomial
     ##
     ## @example
     ## a0 + a1 * x + a2 * x^2 + @dots{} + an * x^n
     ## @end example
     ##
     ## @noindent
     ## from a vector of coefficients [a0 a1 a2 @dots{} an].
     ## @end deftypefn

     function p = polynomial (a)

       if (nargin > 1)
         print_usage ();
       endif

       if (nargin == 0)
         p.poly = [0];
         p = class (p, "polynomial");
       else
         if (strcmp (class (a), "polynomial"))
           p = a;
         elseif (isreal (a) && isvector (a))
           p.poly = a(:).';  # force row vector
           p = class (p, "polynomial");
         else
           error ("@polynomial: A must be a real vector");
         endif
       endif

       superiorto ("double");

     endfunction

   Note that user classes _always_ have higher precedence than built-in
Octave types.  Thus, marking the polynomial class higher than the
"double" class is not actually necessary.

   When confronted with two objects of equal precedence, Octave will use
the method of the object that appears first in the list of arguments.


File: octave.info,  Node: Inheritance and Aggregation,  Prev: Overloading Objects,  Up: Object Oriented Programming

34.5 Inheritance and Aggregation
================================

Using classes to build new classes is supported by Octave through the
use of both inheritance and aggregation.

   Class inheritance is provided by Octave using the ‘class’ function in
the class constructor.  As in the case of the polynomial class, the
Octave programmer will create a structure that contains the data fields
required by the class, and then call the ‘class’ function to indicate
that an object is to be created from the structure.  Creating a child of
an existing object is done by creating an object of the parent class and
providing that object as the third argument of the class function.

   This is most easily demonstrated by example.  Suppose the programmer
needs a FIR filter, i.e., a filter with a numerator polynomial but a
denominator of 1.  In traditional Octave programming this would be
performed as follows.

     octave:1> x = [some data vector];
     octave:2> n = [some coefficient vector];
     octave:3> y = filter (n, 1, x);

   The equivalent behavior can be implemented as a class @FIRfilter.
The constructor for this class is the file ‘FIRfilter.m’ in the class
directory ‘@FIRfilter’.

     ## -*- texinfo -*-
     ## @deftypefn  {} {} FIRfilter ()
     ## @deftypefnx {} {} FIRfilter (@var{p})
     ## Create a FIR filter with polynomial @var{p} as coefficient vector.
     ## @end deftypefn

     function f = FIRfilter (p)

       if (nargin > 1)
         print_usage ();
       endif

       if (nargin == 0)
         p = @polynomial ([1]);
       elseif (! isa (p, "polynomial"))
         error ("@FIRfilter: P must be a polynomial object");
       endif

       f.polynomial = [];
       f = class (f, "FIRfilter", p);

     endfunction

   As before, the leading comments provide documentation for the class
constructor.  This constructor is very similar to the polynomial class
constructor, except that a polynomial object is passed as the third
argument to the ‘class’ function, telling Octave that the FIRfilter
class will be derived from the polynomial class.  The FIR filter class
itself does not have any data fields, but it must provide a struct to
the ‘class’ function.  Given that the @polynomial constructor will add
an element named POLYNOMIAL to the object struct, the @FIRfilter just
initializes a struct with a dummy field POLYNOMIAL which will later be
overwritten.

   Note that the sample code always provides for the case in which no
arguments are supplied.  This is important because Octave will call a
constructor with no arguments when loading objects from saved files in
order to determine the inheritance structure.

   A class may be a child of more than one class (*note class:
XREFclass.), and inheritance may be nested.  There is no limitation to
the number of parents or the level of nesting other than memory or other
physical issues.

   As before, a class requires a ‘display’ method.  A simple example
might be

     function display (f)
       printf ("%s.polynomial", inputname (1));
       display (f.polynomial);
     endfunction

   Note that the FIRfilter’s display method relies on the display method
from the polynomial class to actually display the filter coefficients.

   Once a constructor and display method exist, it is possible to create
an instance of the class.  It is also possible to check the class type
and examine the underlying structure.

     octave:1> f = FIRfilter (polynomial ([1 1 1]/3))
     f.polynomial = 0.33333 + 0.33333 * X + 0.33333 * X ^ 2
     octave:2> class (f)
     ans = FIRfilter
     octave:3> isa (f, "FIRfilter")
     ans =  1
     octave:4> isa (f, "polynomial")
     ans =  1
     octave:5> struct (f)
     ans =

       scalar structure containing the fields:

     polynomial = 0.33333 + 0.33333 * X + 0.33333 * X ^ 2

   The only thing remaining to make this class usable is a method for
processing data.  But before that, it is usually desirable to also have
a way of changing the data stored in a class.  Since the fields in the
underlying struct are private by default, it is necessary to provide a
mechanism to access the fields.  The ‘subsref’ method may be used for
both tasks.

     function r = subsref (f, x)

       switch (x.type)

         case "()"
           n = f.polynomial;
           r = filter (n.poly, 1, x.subs{1});

         case "."
           fld = x.subs;
           if (! strcmp (fld, "polynomial"))
             error ('@FIRfilter/subsref: invalid property "%s"', fld);
           endif
           r = f.polynomial;

         otherwise
           error ("@FIRfilter/subsref: invalid subscript type for FIR filter");

       endswitch

     endfunction

   The "()" case allows us to filter data using the polynomial provided
to the constructor.

     octave:2> f = FIRfilter (polynomial ([1 1 1]/3));
     octave:3> x = ones (5,1);
     octave:4> y = f(x)
     y =

        0.33333
        0.66667
        1.00000
        1.00000
        1.00000

   The "."  case allows us to view the contents of the polynomial field.

     octave:1> f = FIRfilter (polynomial ([1 1 1]/3));
     octave:2> f.polynomial
     ans = 0.33333 + 0.33333 * X + 0.33333 * X ^ 2

   In order to change the contents of the object a ‘subsasgn’ method is
needed.  For example, the following code makes the polynomial field
publicly writable

     function fout = subsasgn (f, index, val)

       switch (index.type)
         case "."
           fld = index.subs;
           if (! strcmp (fld, "polynomial"))
             error ('@FIRfilter/subsasgn: invalid property "%s"', fld);
           endif
           fout = f;
           fout.polynomial = val;

         otherwise
           error ("@FIRfilter/subsasgn: Invalid index type")
       endswitch

     endfunction

so that

     octave:1> f = FIRfilter ();
     octave:2> f.polynomial = polynomial ([1 2 3])
     f.polynomial = 1 + 2 * X + 3 * X ^ 2

   Defining the FIRfilter class as a child of the polynomial class
implies that a FIRfilter object may be used any place that a polynomial
object may be used.  This is not a normal use of a filter.  It may be a
more sensible design approach to use aggregation rather than
inheritance.  In this case, the polynomial is simply a field in the
class structure.  A class constructor for the aggregation case might be

     ## -*- texinfo -*-
     ## @deftypefn  {} {} FIRfilter ()
     ## @deftypefnx {} {} FIRfilter (@var{p})
     ## Create a FIR filter with polynomial @var{p} as coefficient vector.
     ## @end deftypefn

     function f = FIRfilter (p)

       if (nargin > 1)
         print_usage ();
       endif

       if (nargin == 0)
         f.polynomial = @polynomial ([1]);
       else
         if (! isa (p, "polynomial"))
           error ("@FIRfilter: P must be a polynomial object");
         endif

         f.polynomial = p;
       endif

       f = class (f, "FIRfilter");

     endfunction

   For this example only the constructor needs changing, and all other
class methods stay the same.

35 GUI Development
******************

Octave is principally a batch or command-line language.  However, it
does offer some features for constructing graphical interfaces that
interact with users.

   The GUI elements available are I/O dialogs, a progress bar, and UI
elements for plot windows.  For example, rather than hardcoding a
filename for output results a script can open a dialog box and allow the
user to choose a file.  Similarly, if a calculation is expected to take
a long time a script can display a progress bar.  The various UI
elements can be used to fully customize the plot window with menubars,
context menus,

   Several utility functions make it possible to store private data for
use with a GUI which will not pollute the user’s variable space.

   Finally, a program written in Octave might want to have long term
storage of preferences or state variables.  This can be done with
user-defined preferences.

File: octave.info,  Node: I/O Dialogs,  Next: Progress Bar,  Up: GUI Development

35.1 I/O Dialogs
================

Simple dialog menus are available for choosing directories or files.
They return a string variable which can then be used with any command
requiring a filename.

 -- : DIRNAME = uigetdir ()
 -- : DIRNAME = uigetdir (INIT_PATH)
 -- : DIRNAME = uigetdir (INIT_PATH, DIALOG_NAME)
     Open a GUI dialog for selecting a directory.

     If INIT_PATH is not given the current working directory is used.

     DIALOG_NAME may be used to customize the dialog title.

     See also: *note uigetfile: XREFuigetfile, *note uiputfile:
     XREFuiputfile.

 -- : [FNAME, FPATH, FLTIDX] = uigetfile ()
 -- : [...] = uigetfile (FLT)
 -- : [...] = uigetfile (FLT, DIALOG_NAME)
 -- : [...] = uigetfile (FLT, DIALOG_NAME, DEFAULT_FILE)
 -- : [...] = uigetfile (..., "Position", [PX PY])
 -- : [...] = uigetfile (..., "MultiSelect", MODE)

     Open a GUI dialog for selecting a file and return the filename
     FNAME, the path to this file FPATH, and the filter index FLTIDX.

     FLT contains a (list of) file filter string(s) in one of the
     following formats:

     "/path/to/filename.ext"
          If a filename is given then the file extension is extracted
          and used as filter.  In addition, the path is selected as
          current path and the filename is selected as default file.
          Example: ‘uigetfile ("myfun.m")’

     A single file extension "*.ext"
          Example: ‘uigetfile ("*.ext")’

     A 2-column cell array
          containing a file extension in the first column and a brief
          description in the second column.  Example: ‘uigetfile
          ({"*.ext", "My Description";"*.xyz", "XYZ-Format"})’

          The filter string can also contain a semicolon separated list
          of filter extensions.  Example: ‘uigetfile
          ({"*.gif;*.png;*.jpg", "Supported Picture Formats"})’

     DIALOG_NAME can be used to customize the dialog title.

     If DEFAULT_FILE is given then it will be selected in the GUI
     dialog.  If, in addition, a path is given it is also used as
     current path.

     The screen position of the GUI dialog can be set using the
     "Position" key and a 2-element vector containing the pixel
     coordinates.  Two or more files can be selected when setting the
     "MultiSelect" key to "on".  In that case FNAME is a cell array
     containing the files.

     See also: *note uiputfile: XREFuiputfile, *note uigetdir:
     XREFuigetdir.

 -- : [FNAME, FPATH, FLTIDX] = uiputfile ()
 -- : [FNAME, FPATH, FLTIDX] = uiputfile (FLT)
 -- : [FNAME, FPATH, FLTIDX] = uiputfile (FLT, DIALOG_NAME)
 -- : [FNAME, FPATH, FLTIDX] = uiputfile (FLT, DIALOG_NAME,
          DEFAULT_FILE)
     Open a GUI dialog for selecting a file.

     FLT contains a (list of) file filter string(s) in one of the
     following formats:

     "/path/to/filename.ext"
          If a filename is given the file extension is extracted and
          used as filter.  In addition the path is selected as current
          path and the filename is selected as default file.  Example:
          ‘uiputfile ("myfun.m")’

     "*.ext"
          A single file extension.  Example: ‘uiputfile ("*.ext")’

     ‘{"*.ext", "My Description"}’
          A 2-column cell array containing the file extension in the 1st
          column and a brief description in the 2nd column.  Example:
          ‘uiputfile ({"*.ext","My Description";"*.xyz", "XYZ-Format"})’

     The filter string can also contain a semicolon separated list of
     filter extensions.  Example: ‘uiputfile ({"*.gif;*.png;*.jpg",
     "Supported Picture Formats"})’

     DIALOG_NAME can be used to customize the dialog title.  If
     DEFAULT_FILE is given it is preselected in the GUI dialog.  If, in
     addition, a path is given it is also used as current path.

     See also: *note uigetfile: XREFuigetfile, *note uigetdir:
     XREFuigetdir.

   Additionally, there are dialog boxes for printing further help,
warnings or errors and to get textual input from the user.

 -- : H = errordlg ()
 -- : H = errordlg (MSG)
 -- : H = errordlg (MSG, TITLE)
 -- : H = errordlg (MSG, TITLE, CREATEMODE)
     Display an error dialog box with error message MSG and caption
     TITLE.

     The default error message is "This is the default error string."
     and the default caption is "Error Dialog".

     The error message may have multiple lines separated by newline
     characters ("\n"), or it may be a cellstr array with one element
     for each line.

     The return value H is always 1.

     Compatibility Note: The optional argument CREATEMODE is accepted
     for MATLAB compatibility, but is not implemented.  See ‘msgbox’ for
     details.

     Examples:

          errordlg ("Some fancy error occurred.");
          errordlg ("Some fancy error\nwith two lines.");
          errordlg ({"Some fancy error", "with two lines."});
          errordlg ("Some fancy error occurred.", "Fancy caption");

 -- : H = helpdlg ()
 -- : H = helpdlg (MSG)
 -- : H = helpdlg (MSG, TITLE)
     Display a help dialog box with help message MSG and caption TITLE.

     The default help message is "This is the default help string."  and
     the default caption is "Help Dialog".

     The help message may have multiple lines separated by newline
     characters ("\n"), or it may be a cellstr array with one element
     for each line.

     The return value H is always 1.

     Examples:

          helpdlg ("Some helpful text for the user.");
          helpdlg ("Some helpful text\nwith two lines.");
          helpdlg ({"Some helpful text", "with two lines."});
          helpdlg ("Some helpful text for the user.", "Fancy caption");

 -- : CSTR = inputdlg (PROMPT)
 -- : CSTR = inputdlg (PROMPT, TITLE)
 -- : CSTR = inputdlg (PROMPT, TITLE, ROWSCOLS)
 -- : CSTR = inputdlg (PROMPT, TITLE, ROWSCOLS, DEFAULTS)
     Return user input from a multi-textfield dialog box in a cell array
     of strings, or an empty cell array if the dialog is closed by the
     Cancel button.

     Inputs:

     PROMPT
          A cell array with strings labeling each text field.  This
          input is required.

     TITLE
          String to use for the caption of the dialog.  The default is
          "Input Dialog".

     ROWSCOLS
          Specifies the size of the text fields and can take three
          forms:

            1. a scalar value which defines the number of rows used for
               each text field.

            2. a vector which defines the individual number of rows used
               for each text field.

            3. a matrix which defines the individual number of rows and
               columns used for each text field.  In the matrix each row
               describes a single text field.  The first column
               specifies the number of input rows to use and the second
               column specifies the text field width.

     DEFAULTS
          A list of default values to place in each text fields.  It
          must be a cell array of strings with the same size as PROMPT.

     Example:

          prompt = {"Width", "Height", "Depth"};
          defaults = {"1.10", "2.20", "3.30"};
          rowscols = [1,10; 2,20; 3,30];
          dims = inputdlg (prompt, "Enter Box Dimensions", rowscols, defaults);

     questdlg: XREFquestdlg, *note warndlg: XREFwarndlg.

 -- : [SEL, OK] = listdlg (KEY, VALUE, ...)
     Return user inputs from a list dialog box in a vector of selection
     indices (SEL) and a flag indicating how the user closed the dialog
     box (OK).

     The indices in SEL are 1-based.

     The value of OK is 1 if the user closed the box with the OK button,
     otherwise it is 0 and SEL is empty.

     Input arguments are specified in form of KEY, VALUE pairs.  The
     "ListString" argument pair must be specified.

     Valid KEY and VALUE pairs are:

     "ListString"
          a cell array of strings with the contents of the list.

     "SelectionMode"
          can be either "Single" or "Multiple" (default).

     "ListSize"
          a vector with two elements WIDTH and HEIGHT defining the size
          of the list field in pixels.  Default is [160 300].

     "InitialValue"
          a vector containing 1-based indices of preselected elements.
          Default is 1 (first item).

     "Name"
          a string to be used as the dialog caption.  Default is "".

     "PromptString"
          a cell array of strings to be displayed above the list field.
          Default is {}.

     "OKString"
          a string used to label the OK button.  Default is "OK".

     "CancelString"
          a string used to label the Cancel button.  Default is
          "Cancel".

     Example:

          my_options = {"An item", "another", "yet another"};
          [sel, ok] = listdlg ("ListString", my_options,
                               "SelectionMode", "Multiple");
          if (ok == 1)
            disp ("You selected:");
            for i = 1:numel (sel)
              disp (sprintf ("\t%s", my_options{sel(i)}));
            endfor
          else
            disp ("You cancelled.");
          endif

 -- : H = msgbox (MSG)
 -- : H = msgbox (MSG, TITLE)
 -- : H = msgbox (MSG, TITLE, ICON)
 -- : H = msgbox (..., CREATEMODE)
     Display MSG using a message dialog box.

     The message may have multiple lines separated by newline characters
     ("\n"), or it may be a cellstr array with one element for each
     line.

     The optional input TITLE (character string) can be used to decorate
     the dialog caption.

     The optional argument ICON selects a dialog icon.  It can be one of
     "none" (default), "error", "help", or "warn".

     The return value is always 1.

     Compatibility Note: The optional argument CREATEMODE is accepted
     for MATLAB compatibility, but is not implemented.  A valid
     CREATEMODE is either one of the character strings "nonmodal",
     "modal", or "replace", or a structure containing a field
     "WindowStyle" with one of the three character strings.

     Examples:

          msgbox ("Some message for the user.");
          msgbox ("Some message\nwith two lines.");
          msgbox ({"Some message", "with two lines."});
          msgbox ("Some message for the user.", "Fancy caption");

          % A message dialog box with error icon
          msgbox ("Some message for the user.", "Fancy caption", "error");

 -- : BTN = questdlg (MSG)
 -- : BTN = questdlg (MSG, TITLE)
 -- : BTN = questdlg (MSG, TITLE, DEFAULT)
 -- : BTN = questdlg (MSG, TITLE, BTN1, BTN2, DEFAULT)
 -- : BTN = questdlg (MSG, TITLE, BTN1, BTN2, BTN3, DEFAULT)
     Display MSG using a question dialog box and return the caption of
     the activated button.

     The message may have multiple lines separated by newline characters
     ("\n"), or it may be a cellstr array with one element for each
     line.

     The optional TITLE (character string) can be used to specify the
     dialog caption.  It defaults to "Question Dialog".

     The dialog may contain two or three buttons which will all close
     the dialog.

     The string DEFAULT identifies the default button, which is
     activated by pressing the <ENTER> key.  It must match one of the
     strings given in BTN1, BTN2, or BTN3.

     If only MSG and TITLE are specified, three buttons with the default
     captions "Yes", "No", and "Cancel" are used.

     If only two button captions, BTN1 and BTN2, are specified the
     dialog will have only these two buttons.

     Examples:

          btn = questdlg ("Close Octave?", "Some fancy title", "Yes", "No", "No");
          if (strcmp (btn, "Yes"))
            exit ();

 -- : H = warndlg ()
 -- : H = warndlg (MSG)
 -- : H = warndlg (MSG, TITLE)
 -- : H = warndlg (MSG, TITLE, CREATEMODE)
     Display a warning dialog box with warning message MSG and caption
     TITLE.

     The default warning message is "This is the default warning
     string."  and the default caption is "Warning Dialog".

     The warning message may have multiple lines separated by newline
     characters ("\n"), or it may be a cellstr array with one element
     for each line.

     The return value H is always 1.

     Compatibility Note: The optional argument CREATEMODE is accepted
     for MATLAB compatibility, but is not implemented.  See ‘msgbox’ for
     details.

     Examples:

          warndlg ("Some warning text for the user.");
          warndlg ("Some warning text\nwith two lines.");
          warndlg ({"Some warning text", "with two lines."});
          warndlg ("Some warning text for the user.", "Fancy caption");

   For creating new dialog types, there is a dialog function.

 -- : H = dialog (..., "PROPERTY", VALUE, ...)

     Create an empty modal dialog window that other uicontrols can be
     added to.

     The dialog box is a figure object with properties as recommended
     for a dialog box.

     The default properties differing from a figure are:

     buttondownfcn
          ‘if isempty(allchild(gcbf)), close(gcbf), end’

     colormap
          []

     color
          defaultuicontrolbackgroundcolor

     dockcontrols
          off

     handlevisibility
          callback

     integerhandle
          off

     inverthardcopy
          off

     menubar
          none

     numbertitle
          off

     paperpositionmode
          auto

     resize
          off

     visible
          on

     windowstyle
          modal

     Multiple property-value pairs may be specified for the dialog
     object, but they must appear in pairs.

     The return value H is a graphics handle to the created figure.
     object.

     Examples:


          % create an empty dialog window titled 'Dialog Example'
          h = dialog ("name", "Dialog Example");

          % create a button (default style)
          b = uicontrol (h, "string", "OK", "position",[10 10 150 40], "callback","delete(gcf)");

          % wait for dialog to resume or close
          uiwait (h);

35.2 Progress Bar
=================

 -- : H = waitbar (FRAC)
 -- : H = waitbar (FRAC, MSG)
 -- : H = waitbar (..., "createcancelbtn", FCN, ...)
 -- : H = waitbar (..., PROP, VAL, ...)
 -- : waitbar (FRAC)
 -- : waitbar (FRAC, H)
 -- : waitbar (FRAC, H, MSG)
     Return a handle H to a new progress indicator ("waitbar") object.

     The waitbar is filled to fraction FRAC which must be in the range
     [0, 1].

     The optional message MSG is centered and displayed above the
     waitbar.

     A cancel button can be added to the bottom of the waitbar using the
     "createcancelbtn" property of waitbar figures.  The action to be
     executed when the user presses the button is specified using a
     string or function handle FCN.

     The appearance of the waitbar figure window can be configured by
     passing PROP/VAL pairs to the function.

     When called with a single input the current waitbar, if it exists,
     is updated to the new value FRAC.  If there are multiple
     outstanding waitbars they can be updated individually by passing
     the handle H of the specific waitbar to modify.

35.3 UI Elements
================

The ui* series of functions work best with the ‘qt’ graphics toolkit,
although some functionality is available with the ‘fltk’ toolkit.  There
is no support for the ‘gnuplot’ toolkit.

 -- : HUI = uimenu (PROPERTY, VALUE, ...)
 -- : HUI = uimenu (H, PROPERTY, VALUE, ...)
     Create a uimenu object and return a handle to it.

     If H is omitted then a top-level menu for the current figure is
     created.  If H is given then a submenu relative to H is created.

     uimenu objects have the following specific properties:

     "accelerator"
          A string containing the key combination together with CTRL to
          execute this menu entry (e.g., "x" for CTRL+x).

     "callback"
          Is the function called when this menu entry is executed.  It
          can be either a function string (e.g., "myfun"), a function
          handle (e.g., @myfun) or a cell array containing the function
          handle and arguments for the callback function (e.g., {@myfun,
          arg1, arg2}).

     "checked"
          Can be set "on" or "off".  Sets a mark at this menu entry.

     "enable"
          Can be set "on" or "off".  If disabled the menu entry cannot
          be selected and it is grayed out.

     "foregroundcolor"
          A color value setting the text color for this menu entry.

     "label"
          A string containing the label for this menu entry.  A
          "&"-symbol can be used to mark the "accelerator" character
          (e.g., "E&xit")

     "position"
          An scalar value containing the relative menu position.  The
          entry with the lowest value is at the first position starting
          from left or top.

     "separator"
          Can be set "on" or "off".  If enabled it draws a separator
          line above the current position.  It is ignored for top level
          entries.

     Examples:

          f = uimenu ("label", "&File", "accelerator", "f");
          e = uimenu ("label", "&Edit", "accelerator", "e");
          uimenu (f, "label", "Close", "accelerator", "q", ...
                     "callback", "close (gcf)");
          uimenu (e, "label", "Toggle &Grid", "accelerator", "g", ...
                     "callback", "grid (gca)");

 -- : HUI = uicontrol (PROPERTY, VALUE, ...)
 -- : HUI = uicontrol (PARENT, PROPERTY, VALUE, ...)
 -- : uicontrol (H)

     Create a uicontrol object and return a handle to it.

     uicontrols are used to create simple interactive controls such as
     push buttons, checkboxes, edit and list controls.

     If PARENT is omitted then a uicontrol for the current figure is
     created.  If no figure is available, a new figure is created first.

     If PARENT is given then a uicontrol relative to PARENT is created.

     Any provided property value pairs will override the default values
     of the created uicontrol object.

     Uicontrol properties are documented at *note Uicontrol
     Properties::.

     Control of the type of uicontrol created is through the use of the
     STYLE property.  If no style property is provided, a push button
     will be created.

     Valid styles for uicontrol are:

     "checkbox"
          Create a checkbox control that allows user on/off selection.

     "edit"
          Create an edit control that allows user input of single or
          multiple lines of text.

     "listbox"
          Create a listbox control that displays a lit of items and
          allows user selection of single or multiple items.

     "popupmenu"
          Create a popupmenu control that displays a list of options
          that can be selected when the user clicks on the control.

     "pushbutton"
          Create a push button control that allows user to press to
          cause an action.

     "radiobutton"
          Create a radio button control intended to be used for mutually
          exclusive input in a group of radiobutton controls.

     "slider"
          Create a slider control that allows user selection from a
          range of values by sliding knob on the control.

     "text"
          Create a static text control to display single or multiple
          lines of text.

     "togglebutton"
          Create a toggle button control that appears like a push button
          but allows the user to select between two states.

     Examples:

          % create figure and panel on it
          f = figure;
          % create a button (default style)
          b1 = uicontrol (f, "string", "A Button", "position",[10 10 150 40]);
          % create an edit control
          e1 = uicontrol (f, "style", "edit", "string", "editable text", "position",[10 60 300 40]);

 -- : HUI = uipanel (PROPERTY, VALUE, ...)
 -- : HUI = uipanel (PARENT, "PROPERTY, VALUE, ...)

     Create a uipanel object and return a handle to it.

     uipanels are used as containers to group other uicontrol objects.

     If PARENT is omitted then a uipanel for the current figure is
     created.  If no figure is available, a new figure is created first.

     If PARENT is given then a uipanel relative to PARENT is created.

     Any provided property value pairs will override the default values
     of the created uipanel object.

     Uipanel properties are documented at *note Uipanel Properties::.

     Examples:

          % create figure and panel on it
          f = figure;
          p = uipanel ("title", "Panel Title", "position", [.25 .25 .5 .5]);

          % add two buttons to the panel
          b1 = uicontrol ("parent", p, "string", "A Button", "position",[18 10 150 36]);
          b2 = uicontrol ("parent", p, "string", "Another Button", "position",[18 60 150 36]);

 -- : HUI = uipushtool (PROPERTY, VALUE, ...)
 -- : HUI = uipushtool (PARENT, PROPERTY, VALUE, ...)

     Create a uipushtool object and return a handle to it.

     uipushtools are buttons that appear on a figure toolbar.  The
     button is created with a border that is shown when the user hovers
     over the button.  An image can be set using the cdata property.

     If PARENT is omitted then a uipushtool for the current figure is
     created.  If no figure is available, a new figure is created first.
     If a figure is available, but does not contain a uitoolbar, a
     uitoolbar will be created.

     If PARENT is given then an uipushtools is created on the PARENT
     uitoolbar.

     Any provided property value pairs will override the default values
     of the created uipushtool object.

     Uipushtool properties are documented at *note Uipushtool
     Properties::.

     Examples:

          % create figure without a default toolbar
          f = figure ("toolbar", "none");
          % create empty toolbar
          t = uitoolbar (f);

35.4 GUI Utility Functions
==========================

These functions do not implement a GUI element but are useful when
developing programs that do.  The functions ‘uiwait’, ‘uiresume’, and
‘waitfor’ are only available with the ‘qt’ or ‘fltk’ toolkits.

 -- : USED = desktop ("-inuse")
     Return true if the desktop (GUI) is currently in use.

     See also: *note isguirunning: XREFisguirunning.

 -- : DATA = guidata (H)
 -- : guidata (H, DATA)
     Query or set user-custom GUI data.

     The GUI data is stored in the figure handle H.  If H is not a
     figure handle then it’s parent figure will be used for storage.

     DATA must be a single object which means it is usually preferable
     for it to be a data container such as a cell array or struct so
     that additional data items can be added easily.

     See also: *note getappdata: XREFgetappdata, *note setappdata:
     XREFsetappdata, *note get: XREFget, *note set: XREFset, *note
     getpref: XREFgetpref, *note setpref: XREFsetpref.

 -- : HDATA = guihandles (H)
 -- : HDATA = guihandles
     Return a structure of object handles for the figure associated with
     handle H.

     If no handle is specified the current figure returned by ‘gcf’ is
     used.

     The fieldname for each entry of HDATA is taken from the "tag"
     property of the graphic object.  If the tag is empty then the
     handle is not returned.  If there are multiple graphic objects with
     the same tag then the entry in HDATA will be a vector of handles.
     ‘guihandles’ includes all possible handles, including those for
     which "HandleVisibility" is "off".

     See also: *note guidata: XREFguidata, *note findobj: XREFfindobj,
     *note findall: XREFfindall, *note allchild: XREFallchild.

 -- : have_window_system ()
     Return true if a window system is available (X11, Windows, or Apple
     OS X) and false otherwise.

     See also: *note isguirunning: XREFisguirunning.

 -- : isguirunning ()
     Return true if Octave is running in GUI mode and false otherwise.

     See also: *note have_window_system: XREFhave_window_system.

 -- : uiwait
 -- : uiwait (H)
 -- : uiwait (H, TIMEOUT)
     Suspend program execution until the figure with handle H is deleted
     or ‘uiresume’ is called.

     When no figure handle is specified this function uses the current
     figure.  If the figure handle is invalid or there is no current
     figure, this functions returns immediately.

     When specified, TIMEOUT defines the number of seconds to wait for
     the figure deletion or the ‘uiresume’ call.  The timeout value must
     be at least 1.  If a smaller value is specified, a warning is
     issued and a timeout value of 1 is used instead.  If a non-integer
     value is specified, it is truncated towards 0.  If TIMEOUT is not
     specified, the program execution is suspended indefinitely.

     See also: *note uiresume: XREFuiresume, *note waitfor: XREFwaitfor.

 -- : uiresume (H)
     Resume program execution suspended with ‘uiwait’.

     The handle H must be the same as the on specified in ‘uiwait’.  If
     the handle is invalid or there is no ‘uiwait’ call pending for the
     figure with handle H, this function does nothing.

     See also: *note uiwait: XREFuiwait.

 -- : waitfor (H)
 -- : waitfor (H, PROP)
 -- : waitfor (H, PROP, VALUE)
 -- : waitfor (..., "timeout", TIMEOUT)
     Suspend the execution of the current program until a condition is
     satisfied on the graphics handle H.

     While the program is suspended graphics events are still processed
     normally, allowing callbacks to modify the state of graphics
     objects.  This function is reentrant and can be called from a
     callback, while another ‘waitfor’ call is pending at the top-level.

     In the first form, program execution is suspended until the
     graphics object H is destroyed.  If the graphics handle is invalid,
     the function returns immediately.

     In the second form, execution is suspended until the graphics
     object is destroyed or the property named PROP is modified.  If the
     graphics handle is invalid or the property does not exist, the
     function returns immediately.

     In the third form, execution is suspended until the graphics object
     is destroyed or the property named PROP is set to VALUE.  The
     function ‘isequal’ is used to compare property values.  If the
     graphics handle is invalid, the property does not exist or the
     property is already set to VALUE, the function returns immediately.

     An optional timeout can be specified using the property ‘timeout’.
     This timeout value is the number of seconds to wait for the
     condition to be true.  TIMEOUT must be at least 1.  If a smaller
     value is specified, a warning is issued and a value of 1 is used
     instead.  If the timeout value is not an integer, it is truncated
     towards 0.

     To define a condition on a property named ‘timeout’, use the string
     ‘\timeout’ instead.

     In all cases, typing CTRL-C stops program execution immediately.

     isequal: XREFisequal.
